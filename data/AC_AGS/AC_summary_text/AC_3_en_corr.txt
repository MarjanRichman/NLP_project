Interpretation of hydrogeological functioning of a high karst plateau using the KARSYS approach: the case of Trnovsko-Banjška planota (Slovenia)
The high karst plateau of Trnovsko­Banjška planota is one of the most important reservoirs of karst water in Slovenia . 
Almost all important karst springs in this area are captured for water supply . 
A sustainable management of this source of groundwater is of strategic importance , not only as drinking water supply but also for the economy . 
For these reasons , many hydrogeological monitoring studies have been carried out over the last decades . 
However , no consistent regional overview of the hydrogeological functioning of Trnovsko­Banjška planota was available and we decided to study this area with more direct approach based on 3D geological and hydrogeological models . 
The so called KARSYS approach was developed in Switzerland and applied primarily to characterize groundwater reserves within a karst massif , and to sketch the main flow­paths carrying groundwater from recharge areas to the respective springs . 
The delineation of spring catchment areas in karst regions was better defined and interactions between catchments were interpreted . 
These results can be used to improve the management of karst waters in the studied area . 
Key words: KARSYS , karst aquifer , groundwater flow , storage , catchment delineation , water management .
