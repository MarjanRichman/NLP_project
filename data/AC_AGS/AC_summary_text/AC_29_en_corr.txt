Alluvial fans on contact karst: an example from Matarsko podolje , Slovenia . 
Several types of contact karst are found within the Slovenian karst , but the most common is the ponor type , which usually appears between flysch and limestone . 
The most extensive contact of this type is in western Slovenia , in the area of Matarsko podolje , where a variety of typical contact karst depression features can be found . 
In the northwestern part of Matarsko podolje two types of alluvial fans occur . 
One alluvial fan has an active process of alluvial sedimentation on its surface and is distinct in shape , just like alluvial fans in fluvial geomorphic systems . 
The other type represents relict alluvial fans on contact karst . 
They are fan-shaped surface features in carbonate bedrock . 
Their formation is a result of the gradual removal of alluvial cover and the chemical denudation of carbonate bedrock on areas that were covered by alluvial fans . 
Geomorphological features and processes on alluvial fans , and the influences of alluvial fans on the development of contact karst have been investigated in detail . 
Key words: contact karst , karst , alluvial fan , relict alluvial fan , Matarsko podolje .
