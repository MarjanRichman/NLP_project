Adsorptive behaviour of arsenic in a karst subterranean stream and principal components analysis of its influencing variables: A case study at the Lihu subterranean stream , Guangxi province , China
Arsenic (As) pollutants are serious threat to water ecological security and human health , especially in karst areas because of their unique hydrogeological characteristics . 
Physical-chemical analyses of karst water and its sediments at the Lihu subterranean stream , southwest China , were conducted by ICP-MS and xRF to elucidate the reaction mechanisms of arsenic in karst subterranean streams . 
The results show that inorganic arsenic comprise most of the total arsenic , while organic arsenic including monomethylated arsenic (MMA) and dimethyl arsenic (DMA) are not detected or infinitesimal . 
The reducing environment in the subterranean stream makes As(III) dominant and accounts for 53 % of the inorganic species . 
Adsorptive behaviour of arsenic occurred and the removal rates of As , As(III) and As(V) in the Lihu subterranean stream are 51 % , 36 % and 59 % respectively after a 25 . 6 km underground distance . 
To find out the main influencing factors on arsenic adsorptive process in this underground river , principal component analysis in SPSS and Minitab were applied . 
Calcium and bicarbonate turn out to be the main influencing factors for water arsenic adsorption in the study area , largely because the high calcium and alkaline values in karst water . 
This finding is an obvious distinction compared with the research findings at a non-karst area .
