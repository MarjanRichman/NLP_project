Groundwater Contamination in Karst Areas of Southwestern China and Recommended Countermeasures
Approximately 33% of China is karstic . 
The most extensive karst areas are in southwestern China and cover approximately 540 , 000 km2 . 
Southwestern China hosts some of the most typical karst landforms in the world and has important high- quality karst water resources . 
Due to the rapid development of China , karst waters are threatened by various types of contamination . 
Detail field and laboratory investigations in five provinces including several cities in southwestern China were conducted in 2008 and 2009 . 
Eighty-three springs and underground rivers were surveyed and water samples collected from each for laboratory analyses for major ions . 
Four main types of karst aquifer contamination were identified based on contaminant sources: rural and agricultural pollution , pollution from urban development and industry , pollution from mining , and accidental groundwater pollution . 
Several representative instances for each type of contamination and their impacts on the environment are discussed in more detail . 
Contamination countermeasures of karst waters and a framework for overall management of karst water resources in southwestern China are provided .
