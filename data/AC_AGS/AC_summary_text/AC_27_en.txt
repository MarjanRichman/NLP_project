Dolenjska subsoil stone forests and other karst phenomena discovered during the construction of the Hrastje – Lešnica motorway section
This paper explains the investigation of shallow and sediment-covered areas of the Dolenjska karst discovered during the construction of the motorway section between the villages of Hrastje and Lešnica.
Research done during construction has again proved to be very useful; we came to numerous and augmentative conclusions about the development of karst features typical of the Dolenjska region.
Again the importance of the participation of karst researchers in planning major activities concerning the karst and in monitoring the work was demonstrated.
We have researched the unique features of the karst surface marked mostly by large areas of stone forests and characteristic karstification below the thick sediment beds.
Key words: stone forests, subsoil formation of carbonate rock, Dolenjska karst, Slovenia.
