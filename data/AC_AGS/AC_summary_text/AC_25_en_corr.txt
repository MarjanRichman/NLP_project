Partial pressures of CO2 in epikarstic zone deduced from hydrogeochemistry of permanent drips , the Moravian Karst , Czech Republic
Permanent drips from straw stalactites of selected caves of the Moravian Karst were studied during one-year period . 
A hypothetical partial pressure of CO2 that has participated in limestone dissolution , PCO2(H) = 10-1 . 53±0 . 04 , was calculated from the dripwater chemistry . 
The value significantly exceeds the partial pressures generally measured in relevant shallow karst soils , PCO2(soil) = 10-2 . 72±0 . 02 . 
This finding may have important implications for karst / cave conservation and paleoenvironmental reconstructions . 
Keywords: cave , carbon dioxide , dripwater , hydrogeochemistry , hypothetical partial pressure , karst processes , karstification model .
