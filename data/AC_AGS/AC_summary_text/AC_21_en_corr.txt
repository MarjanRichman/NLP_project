Physical Structure of the Epikarst
Epikarst is a weathered zone of enhanced porosity on or near the surface or at the soil / bedrock contact of many karst landscapes . 
The epikarst is essentially the upper boundary of a karst system but is also a reaction chamber where many organics accumulate and react with the percolating water . 
The epikarst stores and directs percolating recharge waters to the underlying karst aquifers . 
Epikarst permeability decreases with depth below the surface . 
The epikarst may function as a perched aquifer with a saturated zone that transmits water laterally for some distance until it drains slowly through fractures or rapidly at shaft drains or dolines . 
Stress-release and physical weathering as well as chemical dissolution play a role in epikarst development . 
Epikarst may be found on freshly exposed carbonates although epikarst that develops below a soil cover should form at a faster rate due to increased carbon dioxide produced by vegetation . 
The accumulation of soil within the fractures may create plugs that retard the downward movement of percolating water and creates a reservoir rich in organic material . 
The thickness of the epikarst zone typically ranges from a few meters to 15 meters , but vertical weathering of joints may be much deeper and lead to a “stone forest” type of landscape . 
Some dolines are hydrologically connected directly to the epikarst while other dolines may drain more directly to the deeper conduit aquifer and represent a “hole” in the epikarst . 
Water stored in the epikarst may be lost to evapotranspiration , move rapidly down vertical shafts or larger joints , or drain out slowly through the soil infillings and small fractures . 
Much of the water pushed from the epikarst during storms is older water from storage that is displaced by the new event water .
