Supportive methods for assessing effective porosity and regulating karst aquifers
Regulation of a karst aquifer implies engineering interventions designed to control its flow and manage its water reserves . 
One of the most important prerequisites for the feasibility and success of regulation projects is proper assessment of aquifer effective porosity (storativity) and accumulated groundwater reserves . 
This paper is focused on several specific methods which can contribute to a reliable assessment of the size and volume of effective storage in karst: cave diving survey , camera logging of cavities , stochastic analysis of discharge regime and 3D modelling of karst interior . 
The application of these methods on selected test sites in Montenegro , Algeria and Serbia are described . 
These methods were applied as part of the research programme conducted in the catchment of Mlava Spring , the largest spring in the Carpathian karst of Serbia . 
The results obtained by the stochastic analyses of the springâ€™s discharge regime , as well as siphon diving of the spring and 3D modelling for reconstruction of conduits networks in karst interior are particularly important . 
Keywords: karst aquifer regulation , effective porosity , cave diving , camera recording , stochastic analysis , 3D conduits modelling .
