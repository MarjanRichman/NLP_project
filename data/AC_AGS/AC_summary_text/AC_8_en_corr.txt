Structural control on development of karst landscape in the Salento Peninsula (Apulia , SE Italy) Apulia region (SE Italy) is particularly prone to karst processes , due to the extensive presence of carbonate rocks . 
Karst marks the whole region , and represents the main landscape features , with a variety of landforms ranging from large-size dolines , to poljes , and fluvial-karstic valleys; given the configuration of Apulia , a great role in the presence of widespread karst features is also played by coastal landforms . 
The Salento peninsula , in southern Apulia , is characterized by very low relief and cropping out of different types of carbonate rocks , ranging in age from Cretaceous to Quaternary . 
Recognition of karst features in this setting , and the likely implications for geohazards , is quite difficult , because of the subtleness of the features , and the facility for man to cancel or modify them . 
Nevertheless , the presence of dolines is definitely a typical aspect of the area , which also implies some consequences in terms of risk to the built-up environment . 
This work focuses on the area of Barbarano del Capo , where two cover-collapse dolines are well known in the geological literature as vora grande and vora piccola . 
Despite the fact that morphometrical and stratigraphical features have already been investigated , few informations are available about the hydro-geomorphological and structural settings of the area . 
This article presents the results of morphological and structural analyses , aimed to understand the role of tectonics in the development of karst features , and their evolution . 
Keywords: sinkholes , karst , tectonics , morphometry , karst landforms , Salento peninsula , Apulia .
