This perspective - which some people also call the social market economy - is actually a new paradigm that goes beyond welfare economics and returns instead to the centrality of the human being . 
Such a paradigm shift necessarily involves consistent support for social policy , including fostering the relevant standards and related corporate responsibility . 
This approach and vision cannot , and must not , have an impact merely within the EU , but must also be applied to external action wherever possible , particularly during the negotiation of agreements . 
Respect for International Labour Organisation standards , the principles laid down in the European Social Charter and social dialogue are just some of the areas that can be discussed on these occasions . 
I believe that the report we have adopted offers sound backing for these objectives . 
in writing . - The external dimension of social policy includes activities and initiatives of the EU aimed at promoting labour and social standards in non-member countries . 
The failure today inside and outside the EU to comply with basic international social standards constitutes a form of social and environmental dumping detrimental to both European enterprises and EU and non-EU workers and citizens . 
Given the globalisation of industry and services , international labour standards are the basis for guaranteeing that the growth of the global economy can benefit all . 
This report demands a change in global governance and in the EU in order to better implement worker ' s rights and working conditions , calling for the strengthening of the core labour standards which are embedded in the eight ILO conventions that focus on the freedom of association and collective bargaining , the elimination of forced and compulsory labour , the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation and the abolition of child labour . 
The external dimension of social policy is aimed at promoting labour and social standards in third countries and at combating social dumping , often the result of globalisation or international trade . 
The Union can no longer tolerate dumping in terms of welfare , health and the environment without reacting to it , as it is responsible for far too many transfers of production outside Europe . 
The ridiculously low labour costs and despicable working conditions should no longer be seen by the Commission as ' natural competitive advantages ' . 
On this point , I insist that the Commission changes its doctrine . 
I voted in favour of the Falbr report because , with the role of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) having recently been downgraded , I think we need to remember the importance of respecting the social rights of workers in the world . 
The European Union should play a leading role on the world stage to force other countries to respect international standards in labour law and thus limit the frantic quest for social dumping . 
It is important for all European players to be involved in the implementation of this policy , be it governments involved in concluding international agreements , or European companies expanding their business into third countries . 
The external dimension of the social policy is aimed at promoting core social standards in third countries in order to meet the Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations and to ensure that workers are protected through compliance with international labour standards . 
The EU is far from being outdone and that is why it should be able to benefit from its credibility and its ' good reputation ' in this regard , with a view to establishing social alliances with its main trading partners and promoting these at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and International Labour Organisation (ILO) . 
Before we let these third countries sit at the same negotiating table as the EU , we must demand that they subscribe to the same core international labour standards . 
The overseas dimension of European policy is not limited to establishing agreements or overseas aid . 
It is more than that . 
In particular , it involves bringing European values to third countries , not just in terms of democratisation and greater respect for fundamental rights , but also of promoting active policies to protect the environment , and the rights of women and children , and of labour standards that respect personal dignity and enable personal development . 
The same can be said for promoting social responsibility standards for companies in third countries . 
This report by Mr Falbr concerns the external dimension of social policy , promoting labour and social standards and European corporate social responsibility . 
The European Union has been a bastion of the defence of workers ' social rights , respect for which is a sine qua non for negotiations with third countries . 
Despite the eight International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions , according to the ILO itself , more than 50% of workers do not enjoy social rights , in particular , immigrants , women and children . 
It is in the EU ' s interests to promote personal dignity and respect for social rights in all the Member States , creating , for that purpose , a mechanism for finding out who is not offering these rights to their workers and penalising them . 
I welcome this report and am voting for it . 
Whilst arguing for the importance of values in a globalising world increasingly dominated by economics , it advocates personal dignity , does not accept the exploitation of individuals , promotes welfare and personal integrated development , and calls on the EU to comply with ILO standards . 
This is yet another enunciation of just concerns and criticisms that , unfortunately , does not get to the bottom of the issues and , for this very reason , ends up being largely inconsequential . 
The 2010 World Social Security Report of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) mentions that more than 50% of workers lack social protection . 
It is in this context that the European Union is implementing a trade policy based on the zealous championing of free trade , which is achieved through the negotiation and conclusion of innumerable bilateral and regional agreements . 
Far from encouraging ' corporate social responsibility ' , which is , in practice , non-existent , these agreements only protect the profits of large companies and financial institutions , and do not give the proper attention to labour rights , to the importance of collective bargaining and workers ' freedom of association , to the effective elimination of discrimination in respect of employment , to the elimination of forced labour , to insecure and poorly paid work , or to child labour . 
This is just an example of an aspect that the report could and should have taken much further . 
It was important to make the European Commission accountable , and demand it provide consistency on policy and action , and a series of effective actions promoting social and labour standards . 
This report contains some positive aspects: the denouncing of multinationals ' constant disrespect for workers ' rights and decent work , and the need to horizontally integrate social policy in all European Union external policy , including so-called corporate social responsibility (CSR) . 
However , the positive aspects are diluted by the failure to demand the implementation of alternative policies that effectively oblige companies to realise their CSR . 
We therefore regret that the call for point 31 - ' Stresses that no directive regulating CSR and enforcing respect for it should be adopted at EU level ' - to be removed has been rejected . 
Parliament should go further than ' requesting ' or ' encouraging ' the Commission to adopt a position and demand the creation of a legislative framework on CSR , with minimum standards that promote respect for the core labour standards advocated by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) in multinational companies and in the European Union itself , and include decent jobs and social clauses both in any bilateral trade agreements that the European Union negotiates and within the World Trade Organisation (WTO) itself . 
For all these reasons , we voted against the report . 
The external dimension of social policy is one of the key priorities of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament . 
It is essential to strengthen employment standards , such as freedom of association , collective bargaining , the elimination of forced and compulsory labour , discrimination in employment and occupations and the abolition of child labour . 
The objective and the endeavour of international employment standards should therefore be to direct economic development particularly towards improving human life and dignity , and not just to establish the conditions and rights of workers . 
Globalisation is , in fact , only serving to pit the workers of all countries against each other in unfair competition , whether through relocations , the immigration of job-seekers or the infamous General Agreement on Trade in Services Mode 4 . 
The problem is that the European Union produces lots of fine talk on the subject but never puts it into practice . 
When have we ever taken practical and specific action as a consequence of coming across situations of intolerable exploitation ? 
When have such situations ever prevented the signing of trade agreements with a country ? 
Never . 
Because while you pretend to be concerned about foreign workers , European workers are being excluded from the picture . 
As the rapporteur - who subscribes to this - points out , ' labour standards should not be used for protectionist trade purposes ' according to the international bodies ! 
So then , what principles , what values , what considerations could ever challenge the absolute power of the market ? 
You talk a lot about the social responsibility of companies who , after all , are only playing by the rules that you have put in place . 
When will the issue of the very heavy social responsibility of the EU ' s political deciders finally be addressed here ? 
I am delighted that the opinion of the Committee on Development , for which I was rapporteur , has been included in this report . 
As we speak , the 100th International Labour Conference is taking place and we all know that the current rules are ineffective . 
In a context of global crisis , it is crucial that the EU sends a strong message calling for a new era of social justice . 
The proposals contained in Mr Falbr ' s report would enable us to take real steps in that direction . 
We can only deplore this policy of double standards when it comes to applying social rights . 
We need to have implementation mechanisms (with incentives and penalties) so that social standards are actually applied . 
A social clause should be added to all EU trade agreements and be legally binding . 
Let me also disapprove of the fact that at paragraph 31 , the report stresses that no European directive enforcing respect for corporate social responsibility should be adopted . 
I insist on the need to move towards more social justice and to ensure workers ' rights are respected worldwide , particularly in our dealings with developing countries . 
The economic and financial crisis which is presently raging in Europe , but also in the rest of the world , is combined with a serious social crisis . 
In this difficult context , the European Union and its businesses have a substantial social responsibility in the relations they maintain with third countries . 
For this reason , I was keen to stress , through my vote , the need for the European Union to ensure that social standards and workers ' rights are adhered to when signing agreements with these countries . 
The European Union , through the values it enshrines , must ensure that the standards governing its labour law are promoted and disseminated all over the world . 
Europe has a duty to be a model . 
That is why I also voted in favour of provisions which emphasise corporate social responsibility . 
I welcomed this document because , at the turn of the century , the EU changed its strategy for the external dimension of social policy from a hard to a soft approach , i . e . from focusing on linking social standards with trade agreements to focusing rather on international cooperation and dialogue . 
The EU uses different types of instruments to implement social policy in non-member countries . 
These are hard , soft and financial instruments . 
The use of these instruments is proof that the EU expects certain behaviour in its relations with its trading partners . 
Nevertheless , the stumbling block is the implementation of these instruments and their enforcement in partner countries . 
It is therefore crucial for the EU to focus more thoroughly on their implementation and enforcement , especially the International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions and the principles of corporate social responsibility . 
This is often hindered by the country ' s legal order; however , weak political will and internal economic pressure are also at play . 
The fact that workers do not know their rights is another important factor . 
in writing . - According to the report , the EU has a unique combination of economic dynamism with a social model . 
It creates equal opportunities in education , training and the labour market and equal access to social services . 
The report stresses the fact that there is a need for implementation of decent work programmes that reflect national needs and priorities regarding employment and social policy , and are based on agreement between employers , workers and governments . 
This aspect is very important in the actual context . 
These are several of the reasons why I endorse this report . 
People matter most , and that is why it is so important to promote employment and social standards . 
People living in rural areas and , in particular , women and young people , are a good example . 
The overwhelming majority of farms are owned by men . 
I believe that women should be supported to ensure that this imbalance is corrected . 
In my opinion , it is also important to support young farmers who take over farms from their parents . 
As far as young people are concerned , the quality of education in rural areas should be improved , and young people should be guaranteed access to non-rural opportunities for learning and personal development . 
The next key issue is corporate social responsibility . 
This means that businesses take action on a day-to-day basis to protect society and the environment , on their own initiative and irrespective of any legal regulations . 
Businesses are no longer only geared towards profit . 
They are starting to be characterised by an ever-greater awareness of social and environmental protection issues . 
I voted in favour of this report as I believe that businesses have a social responsibility - towards their employees and customers , the environment and society at large . 
A new term has been added to the German dictionary: Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) . 
This is - and should remain - a voluntary matter . 
In our globalised markets , CSR entails much more than making a donation to the local football club . 
Businesses that operate in a globally responsible way help shape foreign policy and development policy . 
They are Europe ' s ambassadors to the world , flying the flag for Europe ' s social standards worldwide . 
We should support CSR , not regulate it . 
In this case , Europe ' s role should be that of a moderator , not a regulator . 
This principle must be applied if the European Commission is to get serious and take up the topic of CSR once again: we do not need excessive regulation . 
We have underlined this position with this report . 
I believe that Mr Falbr has drafted a good report , and so I would like to explain why I decided to vote in favour of its adoption . 
The promotion of high labour standards , social standards and corporate social responsibility represents an extremely large challenge for the external dimension of social policy . 
One of the problems which the rapporteur highlights is the inefficiency of the administrative bodies responsible for employment policy . 
Ongoing and constructive cooperation with third countries , involving both the European Union as a whole and the individual Member States , may serve as a source of good practices in terms of establishing the appropriate administrative capabilities . 
I believe that cooperation at regional and local levels and with businesses also yields good results . 
An excellent example of partnership , support and exchange of experience which has yielded positive results is the cooperation between Polish regions and the countries in the Eastern Partnership over the last few years . 
I voted in favour of the resolution on the external dimension of the European Union ' s social policy . 
The European Union is seen around the world as an attractive and sought-after partner , and this owes much to the unique way in which it combines economic dynamism with a social model . 
The latter should be promoted by the EU in its relations with other countries and should involve consistent action between the two dimensions , internal and external . 
The current text insists on the need to promote corporate social responsibility in particular . 
The latter requires trading companies to take into consideration the social and environmental dimensions . 
The resolution highlights that this promotion should not be binding , but rather should be the result of interaction between the stakeholders on a voluntary basis . 
Finally it is also aimed at incorporating within international negotiations the rights of workers , which the International Labour Organisation is tasked with defending , as well as promoting a global economic governance that takes these parameters into account . 
in writing . - I welcome this report . 
Core labour standards are embedded in the eight ILO conventions that focus on the freedom of association and collective bargaining , the elimination of forced and compulsory labour , the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation , and the abolition of child labour . 
It is clear not only from these conventions but also from the report of the World Commission on the Social Dimension of Globalisation that it is necessary to change the narrow focus on markets into a wider interest in people , i . e . focus on the protection of workers ' rights and the rule of labour law . 
In order for the EU to negotiate with non-member countries , the latter must respect all the abovementioned . 
This is a condition without which negotiations with non-member countries are impossible . 
Trade policy cannot ignore any failure in respecting workers ' rights , and the development of society may therefore only continue after these drawbacks are removed . 
By setting labour standards , the EU supports opportunities for men and women to obtain decent and productive work in conditions of freedom , equality , security and dignity . 
Given the current globalisation , international labour standards are the basis which guarantees that the growth of the global economy will benefit all . 
The aim and much of the content of Mr Falbr ' s report is , in my view , very positive . 
I also consider the focus on employment and decent working conditions to be a key element of sustainable development , and not just in EU countries . 
Like the rapporteur , I regret that there is no single definition of a ' social clause ' which would be usable not in bilateral trade agreements , but in the creation of decent employment conditions for workers . 
The social models of some European countries could also serve as a good example to developing countries . 
I also share the opinion on the joint fight to eliminate child labour . 
Despite the above , I abstained from the vote because it is impossible to implement social demands in bilateral trade agreements in the absence of a clear definition of respect for human rights . 
This criterion must not be used as an argument against the signing of agreements . 
 ' That the spirit of revolutionary change which has long been disturbing the nations of the world should have passed beyond the sphere of politics and made its influence felt in the related sphere of practical economics is not surprising ' . 
These are the words of the beloved Pope John Paul II who , in his encyclical entitled Centesimus Annus , reprised the subjects tackled by his predecessor Leo XIII in the encyclical Rerum Novarum . 
His purpose in doing so was to analyse and contribute to the social ' question ' which - today as in 1991 - can only be resolved by referring to Christian doctrine and , hence , by recognising the absolutely indiscriminate dignity of the human being and the worker . 
I voted in favour of the report by Mr Falbr since it focuses precisely on the importance of safeguarding human rights and the fact that the European social model is an important starting point , including in terms of the Union ' s external relations . 
Social responsibility must work to this end and the European Union - working through Parliament - must restore and reinforce these principles in its every action , above all in dealing with non-Member States whose citizens are denied fundamental rights . 
As Vice-Chair of the Committee on Women ' s Rights and Gender Equality , I feel compelled to underline how important it is that we all cooperate , including outside the EU , to eliminate gender discrimination and gender violence so as to restore the social dignity of women and revive their active contribution to the local and supranational economy alike . 
The globalisation of the economy and the relocation of European companies have led to concerns regarding the external dimension of social policy . 
This includes EU activities and initiatives aimed at promoting labour and social standards in third countries . 
Core labour standards are embedded in the eight International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions that focus on the freedom of association and collective bargaining , the elimination of forced and compulsory labour , the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation , and the abolition of child labour . 
In order for third countries to negotiate with the EU , they must respect all the ideas outlined above . 
This is a condition without which negotiations with third countries are impossible . 
Trade policy cannot ignore any failure in respecting workers ' rights and the development of society may continue only after such obstacles have been removed . 
It is essential to use international labour standards to ensure economic development remains very focused on improving human life and personal dignity , and not on determining conditions and rights of workers . 
in writing . - The external dimension of social policy is a key priority for our group and for me . 
We have recently adopted a resolution concerning the future convention on domestic workers to be adopted in June 2011 . 
This report calls more generally for the strengthening of the core labour standards which are embedded in ILO conventions , including freedom of association and collective bargaining , elimination of forced and compulsory labour , elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation and the abolition of child labour . 
The S&D Group demands a change in global governance and in the EU in order to better implement workers ' rights and working conditions . 
The failure today inside and outside the EU to comply with basic international social standards constitutes a form of social and environmental dumping detrimental to European enterprises and workers . 
I voted in favour . 
I support the principles set down in the report . 
However , I would point out that these are lofty aims that will be difficult , if not impossible , to achieve in reality . 
We already have countless trade agreements that make no demands in terms of adherence to social standards . 
As long as this obvious discrepancy exists , the effectiveness and rationale of this report will necessarily be limited . 
The report calls on the Member States to implement core labour law standards for businesses in their own countries . 
Should not this also extend to businesses outside of Europe ? 
It also seems to me that the report claims to combat the negative effects of globalisation , although , in the final analysis , this cannot be achieved with the measures discussed here . 
For that reason , I have abstained from voting . 
In this report , the European Union has set itself very ambitious targets based on well-conceived principles . 
The Member States are being called on to implement core labour law standards for businesses in their own countries . 
Unfortunately , this call does not seem to extend to businesses outside of Europe at present . Although I am in favour of the principles behind the report , I do not believe its conclusions are absolutely correct , which is why I abstained from voting . 
The European Union ' s external social policy , targeted at countries not wishing to join the EU , should , first and foremost , be coherent , pragmatic and uniform . 
Both internal and external social policy should promote labour standards and also social standards , which are among the EU ' s most important objectives . 
In connection with the above , all Member States concluding agreements with third countries should ensure that their position aligns with the European social model . We should demand that countries not wishing to join the EU respect the right of association and that they take steps to prevent discrimination on the grounds of gender or age . 
The elimination of child labour and citizens ' right to improve their professional qualifications are very significant issues . 
As far as development cooperation is concerned , the European Union has enough funds to create sufficient structures in the field of vocational education and training . 
It is absolutely crucial for the European Commission to make adjustments for the current situation and realities of life in the country in question when negotiating partnership agreements . 
The European Parliament has gained new competences since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon , and it should cooperate actively with European and international trade unions in order to improve the social situation . 
I voted in favour of the report on the external dimension of social policy , promoting labour and social standards and European corporate social responsibility . 
Our objective is to promote labour and social standards and European corporate social responsibility outside the EU . 
This is a legitimate objective; however , I have certain reservations as to whether we shall be able to achieve this objective . 
The common social standards that we cite are at risk and the intention to promote different social and labour standards within the EU itself is now becoming clear . 
The standards that apply in my country , in Greece , where unemployment rates among 25-year-olds are 36 . 1% and in Spain , where this rate is 43% , are very different from the standards that apply in the strong European economies . 
This report reminds us that , if the EU wishes to become a leader in the world in terms of social policy , it needs to safeguard cohesion between the social policies applied in its Member States . 
I voted for this report on the external dimension of social policy , promoting labour and social standards and European corporate social responsibility . 
Although the Lisbon strategy and the Europe 2020 strategy place unprecedented emphasis on social policy , competitiveness issues and economic factors continue to take priority over social issues . 
It is essential to defend our labour standards , which are embedded in the eight International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions that focus on the freedom of association and collective bargaining , the elimination of forced and compulsory labour , the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation , and the abolition of child labour . 
There is a need to focus on the protection of workers ' rights and the rule of labour law . 
In order for third countries to negotiate with the EU , they must respect all the ideas outlined above . 
This should be a condition for negotiations with third countries . 
Trade policy cannot ignore any failure in respecting workers ' rights , and the development of society may continue only after such obstacles have been removed . 
The external dimension of the European Union ' s social policy aims to promote social standards in non-member countries , but the issues of competitiveness and economic factors continue to take priority over social and labour issues . 
There are currently eight International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions that have been ratified by all EU Member States . 
These should lead to the creation of a bedrock of international rules shared by all Member States . 
In general , we still need to focus on people as human beings , which can be achieved by protecting the rights of workers and the right to work . 
The ILO plays an essential role on the international scene by drawing up , promoting and translating these standards into reality . 
Businesses must also contribute to sustainable development in order to foster good conditions for workers , but the difference between developed and developing countries still lies in their systems of social protection . 
I am voting in favour of the proposal under discussion in light of the above and also in order that there may be greater promotion of labour and social standards in EU Member States and non-Member States alike , as well as respect for fundamental international labour standards . 
Core labour standards embedded in the eight ILO conventions focus on the freedom of association and collective bargaining , the elimination of forced and compulsory labour , the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation , as well as the abolition of child labour . 
Consequently , greater attention must be focused on protecting workers ' rights and labour legislation . 
A significant improvement needs to be made to the legal and social position of women to prevent discrimination and utilise the potential contribution from women to economic and social development . 
I call on the Commission and Member States to enforce the right not to be discriminated against , which means the right to work and equal treatment , irrespective of gender , ethnic origin , age and disability , as a key principle in the fight against poverty . 
I call on the Commission and Member States to cooperate with partner countries with the aim of placing greater emphasis on combating child labour with a view to creating instead decent jobs for adults and allowing children to receive a suitable education . 
The freedom of association for trade unions and the right to bargain collectively must be implemented without exception in order to improve and protect decent working conditions . 
in writing . - Promoting labour standards through the EU ' s negotiations with third party countries benefits both the Member States and the third party countries . 
By promoting higher safety standards and better pay , the EU is helping improve workers ' lives . 
By insisting on better pay , the EU is also ensuring that there is a market in third party countries for EU exports . 
If we allow imports into Europe from countries that do not ensure fair wages , we are effectively pricing European companies out of the market . 
It is harder for EU companies to compete with third party countries who do not observe the same safety standards and who can pay employees much lower salaries . 
However , it is important to note the dangers involved in ' soft law ' approaches to labour standards . 
As well as the fact that such rules are not binding and that there is no sanction if they are breached , it also risks reducing traditional supervisory systems in favour of informal monitoring procedures . 
Therefore , the EU must be vigilant and ensure that standards are adhered to and , if not , then action must be taken . 
In an increasingly globalised world , it is essential that the EU make use of its international influence to ensure that workers ' rights are protected in a model that respects personal dignity . 
A series of issues emerges in this context , such as choosing the appropriate instrument for the EU to exert its influence . 
Furthermore , it should not be forgotten how powerful the EU can be when we are talking about relations with a country that either wants to accede to the Union or is a beneficiary of EU aid programmes . 
Finally , in a context in which a significant part of the economy depends on multinational companies , there is also a need for organisations to be socially responsible . 
in writing . - In favour . 
The external dimension of social policy includes activities and initiatives of the EU aimed at promoting labour and social standards in non-Member States . 
Although the Lisbon strategy gave - and the EU 2020 gives - to social policy an emphasis that is greater than ever before , the issues of competitiveness and economic factors continue to take priority over social issues . 
Core labour standards are embedded in the eight ILO conventions that focus on the freedom of association and collective bargaining , the elimination of forced and compulsory labour , the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation and the abolition of child labour . 
It is clear not only from these conventions but also from the report of the World Commission on the Social Dimension of Globalisation that it is necessary to change the narrow focus on markets into a wider interest in people , i . e . focus on the protection of workers ' rights and the rule of labour law . 
In order for the EU to negotiate with non-Member States , they must respect all the abovementioned issues . 
This is a condition without which negotiations with non-Member States are impossible . 
Trade policy cannot ignore any failure to respect workers ' rights and therefore , the development of society may continue only after these drawbacks are removed . 
A business may say that it is socially responsible when it commits to a robust structure that is capable of taking account not only of economic outcomes , but also of the social and environmental results of its actions . 
These days , we ask not merely how businesses achieve their economic results , but also who they hire and how staff are treated . 
A responsible business is an active and aware participant in the social reality in which it operates , and makes its relationships with all the parties involved in its activities the main source of its prosperity . 
Through the report adopted today , the European Union has committed itself to taking a world-leading role on social policy by promoting its objectives on a global scale , thereby underlining the importance of the role attributed to Parliament by the Treaty of Lisbon . 
I am in favour of this own-initiative report since it deals with promoting corporate social responsibility as a voluntary motivational tool designed to stimulate business growth . 
European businesses are the engine of the European Union ' s economy and that is why there must be a greater European commitment to protecting businesses in the EU , which often find themselves having to compete with unscrupulous partners . 
In addition , I am in favour of the creation of socially responsible enterprises , whose core principles are the social protection of workers , the protection of consumers and observance of transparency laws . 
I voted in favour of this resolution because it emphasises the pivotal role that the European Union wants and should play with respect to third countries , especially with the EU ' s trading partners . 
Failure to comply with basic international social standards constitutes a form of social and environmental dumping to the detriment of European companies and workers . 
This is one of the points I was keen to stress in the opinion of the Committee on International Trade on this issue , for which I was rapporteur . 
However the EU cannot do everything on its own: it must cooperate more with the relevant international organisations (ILO , WTO , OECD) , in particular , for combating the phenomenon of free zones , as these go against any social legislation . 
Moreover , while corporate social responsibility is currently well-established in Europe , European companies , their subsidiaries and their subcontractors play a vital role in promoting and disseminating social and labour standards around the world because of their weight in international trade . 
The Commission must encourage them in this regard , particularly by seeking and promoting best practices . 
I voted in favour of Mr Falbr ' s report because I consider that the promotion of corporate social responsibility in Europe needs to be increased , in a bid to respond directly to the need to defend common values and to increase solidarity and cohesion between Europeans . 
Corporate social responsibility must be the main aspect of the European social model , in a bid to boost innovation and competitiveness and contribute to employability and job creation , at a time when unemployment rates are increasing drastically and young Europeans , our sustainable force , are looking for alternatives outside the borders of Europe . 
I voted in favour of the Falbr report , which seeks to promote labour and social standards when the EU negotiates with third countries . 
The report takes as its basis a number of ILO conventions and , on the basis of these , it proposes that the EU should protect workers ' rights and the rule of labour law when the EU enters into trade agreements with third countries , for example . 
The report proposes , among other things , that minimum requirements for corporate social responsibility be laid down by means of a legal framework , that the term be better defined and that fulfilment of the requirements be better monitored . 
At the same time , the report rejects the use in trade agreements of the ' MODE4 process ' , which allows international companies to import their own labour force , thereby circumventing the host country ' s social and working conditions . 
Quite apart from the fact that this puts the imported labour force in a worse position than that of the host country , it also contributes to social dumping . 
The EU currently has the power to enter into trade agreements with third countries on behalf of all of the Member States of the EU . 
I am opposed to this . 
However , as long as this remains the case , it will also be necessary to lay down requirements specifying what these trade agreements are to contain . 
in writing . - I supported this report , which precedes the Commission communication on CSR . 
I also welcome the work done by my colleague , Richard Howitt , at committee stage to produce a report that promotes the positive work that corporate social responsibility can do at European level . 
Europe is a basic player in globalised procedures and bears an important share of responsibility for producing results that contribute to viable forms of development . 
The European Union is at the vanguard in promoting social policies at global level and calls on developing countries to respect WTO contracts . 
The Falbr report also mentions the importance of corporate social responsibility and compliance with it by companies in the EU , given that their assumption of corporate social responsibility makes a decisive contribution in promoting social prosperity and environmental protection and in combating poverty in countries in which they are active . 
That is why I voted for the report . 
in writing . - The EU 2020 strategy demonstrates that social policy is a fundamental priority for Europe . 
However , more needs to be done to make improvements in this area and it is for this reason that I supported this report . 
The report calls for the elimination of forced labour as well as the abolition of child labour , and also highlights the need for more focus on the protection of workers ' rights . 
Non-member countries must adhere to basic principles such as these if the EU is to work and trade with them . 
Member States must also cooperate with partner countries to ensure the protection of vulnerable groups and to fight gender discrimination as well as discrimination on grounds of ethnicity , religion , age and disability . 
I hope that the Commission will come forward with some concrete proposals which will bring about improved labour and social standards , as well as proposals to promote corporate social responsibility in its external polices . 
The rapporteur complains that people are still not the focus for social policy and that the human factor is still required to take a back seat to the competitiveness factor . 
As the report explains , the EU enjoys a good worldwide reputation in terms of the ideal link between economic dynamism and a social model , which also gives rise to a certain responsibility . 
The EU should no longer be allowed to operate a double-standard , for which reason I am in complete agreement with the rapporteur . 
I am voting for this report because vocational education and training should be accessible , available and possible at all times of life , regardless of people ' s status on the labour market or of their income . 
I voted in favour of this resolution on European cooperation in vocational education and training to support the Europe 2020 strategy . 
The possibility and ability to learn and work in an international context is a prerequisite for a successful working life in a globalised economy . 
There is a growing need for mobile , flexible employees with international experience . 
Especially where young people are concerned , action needs to be taken immediately: youth unemployment is one of Europe ' s most pressing challenges . 
Member States must adopt targeted political strategies to combat poverty , taking into account specific national circumstances and needs . 
I agree with the provision laid down in the resolution that the aims set out in the Europe 2020 strategy , namely , to reduce the school drop-out rate to below 10% and ensure that 40% of young people are educated to university level , must be tackled by means of specific , creative and effective measures . 
Given that demographic changes are fuelling the need for training and adding to the necessity to participate in lifelong learning , workers must be provided with a means of determining and planning their own training needs . 
Furthermore , in order to enable people at different times of life and specific groups to have access to vocational education and training , financing opportunities should be broadened , simplified and made more readily available under the Lifelong Learning Programme and by implementing Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs . 
We must ensure that Europe ' s workers are able to adapt to the requirements of the economy . 
This despicable report maps the EU ' s strategic aim to come out on top in the competition for the monopolies with other imperialist centres , by promoting the integration of education into the quantifiable targets of the reactionary EU 2020 strategy which need to be ' transformed ' into national targets . 
Within the framework of this global plan , particular attention is given to technical and vocational education , which is allocated the role of serving the needs of the cheapest possible , disenfranchised workforce worthy of the ' labour market ' and ' competitiveness ' . 
That is why education and training courses must meet both current and future market needs . 
Subjugation to the choices and plans of the capitalist undertaking must be strengthened , while ' employability ' and entry to the labour market via apprenticeship , mobility in sectors of the economy and so-called accessibility between levels of education and training must be facilitated . 
Pronouncements about ' equal opportunities ' and ' free choice ' and satisfaction of the needs of young people conceal adaptation to the needs of the capitalist economy , which means a policy of class barriers in education adapted to the mediaeval labour practices of the ' memoranda ' and of EU 2020 . 
The economic crisis has turned the European Union labour market completely upside down . 
There is no large business area which has been left unscathed by the damaging consequences of this crisis , with the effects reaching the level of the citizen in the form of job insecurity , unemployment and poor conditions or opportunities for finding new employment . 
Vocational education and training are proving , in this context , to be a new opportunity , a new way of enabling European citizens ' lives to return to normal . 
I am alarmed by the high youth unemployment rate . 
I believe that with the right education and ongoing training , many young people in Europe will manage to find themselves a well-paid job , appropriate to their vocational training or retraining . 
I congratulate the rapporteur for this dossier . 
I conclude , along with Nadja Hirsch , that if we want to fulfil these wishes , vocational education and training need to be clearly results-orientated . 
There must be one objective for 2020: every young person must have a job . 
The data in the report by Mrs Hirsch is alarming: the youth unemployment rate is now 21% , twice the average rate of unemployment at EU level . 
The motion contains useful ideas and should surely be seen in a positive light , yet I am convinced that we need to provide adequate financial resources in order to properly tackle the challenges posed by the Copenhagen Process and the EU 2020 strategy , for instance through the Structural Funds and , in particular , through the European Social Fund . 
With regret , I must also say that there is no comprehensive and all-inclusive approach shared by all Member States . 
Without a coordinated initiative that brings together the sectors of vocational training , professional qualifications , lifelong learning and apprenticeship to the labour market , I do not see how we can manage to ensure that we will achieve the goals of the EU 2020 strategy entitled ' An Agenda for new skills and jobs ' . 
I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Hirsch aimed at making comparisons between and within education systems . 
I am convinced that education should be more tailored to the needs of the labour market and should encourage creativity , innovation and entrepreneurship . 
Therefore , this report seeks to facilitate the mobility of teachers and students , and to simplify the recognition procedures for foreign professional qualifications , which is essential . 
The possibility and ability to learn and work in an international context is a prerequisite for a successful working life in a globalised economy . 
There is a growing need for mobile , flexible employees with international experience . 
The Europe 2020 strategy lists the key factors for smart growth (fostering knowledge , innovation and education , and promoting the digital society) , sustainable growth (more resource-efficient production going hand in hand with enhanced competitiveness) , and inclusive growth (increasing the employment rate , training , and eradicating poverty) . 
What is needed , as far as vocational education and training are concerned , is to take practical steps at EU level and in the Member States . 
Action needs to be taken immediately , especially where the level of youth unemployment is concerned . 
It is not just that the unemployment rate is higher among young workers than among their adult counterparts: young people are also to be found more frequently in temporary jobs with lower pay and less social security cover . 
I agree that in order to fully realise the EU 2020 flagship initiative ' An Agenda for new skills and jobs ' , the EU institutions should embark on a more pragmatic , comprehensive and wide-ranging initiative supported by all Member States which should focus on connecting the areas of vocational education , professional qualifications , lifelong learning , apprenticeships and the labour market . 
The EU is experiencing a severe economic , financial and social crisis . 
The consequences of this crisis have been primarily felt in the field of employment . 
There are currently 22 . 82 million unemployed people in the European Union . 
Young people under the age of 25 continue to be the worst hit , with unemployment at 21 . 3% in this age range . 
On the one hand , it is estimated that , by 2020 , almost 15 . 6 million new jobs will be created for highly qualified people , but , on the other hand , 12 million jobs for people with few or no qualifications will be lost . 
The Europe 2020 strategy aims to respond to these new prospects for the professional world . 
This report stresses the need to develop European-level cooperation in the field of vocational education and training to increase transparency and for ease of comparison between the various education systems . 
This report also stresses the importance of promoting the transposition and implementation of European legislation to facilitate the mobility of teaching staff and students , as well as to simplify procedures for recognising foreign vocational qualifications . 
I therefore voted for this report . 
While youth unemployment is currently 21% in the European Union , and close to 25% in my country , this has become a major challenge for Europe at a time when young Europeans deprived of employment are threatened with social exclusion and poverty . 
The EU only has marginal responsibility on these issues . 
However , it seems that it can offer , if not solutions , at least interesting food for thought: it appears obvious to me that training and education should be at the heart of the political priorities of today and of tomorrow . 
The report calls on Member States to exchange good practices regarding their vocational education system and training systems combined with work experience , which should be extended in many Member States , particularly in France . 
These recommendations are going in the right direction to improve education and training in connection with the labour market and to reduce unemployment and social exclusion , but they will not be enough if Member States and the Commission do not make sufficient efforts at a time when youth unemployment is becoming the major political challenge in many Member States , particularly in my country , France . 
In today ' s globalised economy , the possibility and ability to learn and work in an international context is a prerequisite for a successful working life for European citizens . 
In spite of the severe effects that the economic crisis is having on the European labour market , industrial and technological change increases the need for workers with high and intermediate skill levels . 
As far as vocational education and training are concerned , the key factors listed in the Europe 2020 strategy for smart , sustainable and inclusive growth need to be translated into practical steps at European Union level . 
To attain these goals , it is essential for education and vocational training to be treated as a long-term common political priority , which can only be realised with the participation and commitment of all stakeholders , the EU institutions and those involved at local and regional level . 
At this point , I would emphasise that action needs to be taken quickly , especially where young people are concerned: the rise in youth unemployment is , in fact , one of Europe ' s most pressing challenges . 
The aims set out in the Europe 2020 strategy - namely , to reduce the school drop-out rate to below 10% and ensure that 40% of young people are educated to university level - must be tackled with efficient and practical measures . 
In the age of a Europe without borders , education is a fundamental step in planning the professional lives of citizens , particularly at international level . 
Young people should be able to take advantage of the opportunities to acquire knowledge and experience provided by membership of their country in the European Union . 
The ever greater demand for mobile workers who have received a broad education is a further factor in favour of this lifestyle . 
In view of the above , unemployment among young people remains a worrying problem . 
The implementation of projects aimed at combating this hazardous phenomenon is an urgent issue . 
Every investment made in education helps to ensure a better future for young people . 
The use of European funds to launch concrete programmes in the field of vocational education and development is therefore particularly important . 
I thus agree with the need to develop instruments supporting ' lifelong learning ' or , in other words , the regular improvement of qualifications . 
Creative and effective educational programmes should make it possible to accomplish one of the overriding objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy , namely , to ensure that at least 40% of people complete higher education . 
I do not intend to support Mrs Hirsch ' s own-initiative report , not so much because of its statements of principle , which are commendable in terms of emphasising the importance of bringing the labour market and the world of formal training closer together , but because , once again , we are lacking a practical , proactive approach to the issue that transcends sterile considerations and offers concrete solutions to resolve a social emergency that cannot be resolved through rhetoric . 
I voted in favour of this report because I agree that demographic changes and increasing longevity mean that working lives will be more varied , and retraining and participation in lifelong learning have already become a necessity . 
Consequently , the report draws attention to the need to modernise both initial and continuing vocational education and training , proposes concluding basic education with a career aptitude assessment and stresses the importance of initial training for teachers . 
It also emphasises the importance , at local and regional level , of fostering effective cooperation between schools , training agencies , research centres and firms , in order to overcome the inward-looking nature of education systems and the mismatch between knowledge and skills and the needs of the labour market . 
I agree that in order to modernise training and education , we must strengthen the link between potential employers and schools , and therefore the inclusion of social partners in curriculum development would be another step towards greater employment in Europe . 
The Europe 2020 strategy states that the key factors for smart growth are not only fostering knowledge , innovation , and education , and promoting the digital society , but also sustainable and inclusive growth . 
The key to achieving these , in this case , is vocational education and training , for which all Member States must adopt the same standards . 
In spite of the severe impact which the economic crisis is having on the European labour market , it can be assumed that employment growth in Europe will recover , at least gradually , over the next 10 years . 
The projections suggest that the demand for skills will continue to rise . 
Industrial and technological change increases the demand for workers with high and intermediate skill levels , with low-skilled labour being squeezed out . 
There is ever-increasing emphasis on a clear , results-orientated learning approach . 
Reforms have already been implemented in vocational education systems in some Member States . 
As regards the comparability of vocational education and training systems in Member States , the priorities must be to break down barriers , increase transparency and facilitate comparison within and between the different systems . 
I voted in favour of this report because , as it clearly points out , young people are the real resource of the future . 
Hence , we have a duty to ensure that they all have access to vocational education and training . 
The economic crisis that has struck Europe and elsewhere over the last few years has affected young people the most . 
Unemployment among that age group has sharply increased , and those who do find a job have to settle for fixed-term contracts and for being underpaid . 
We need to work effectively and quickly in order to give some dignity back to these young people , who want to work and , above all , become part of a world in which they are unlikely to be accepted with open arms . 
These objectives can also be found in the Europe 2020 strategy where it establishes the obligation to focus on smart , sustainable and inclusive growth . 
Generally speaking , Mrs Hirsch ' s report is a good starting point for what must become one of the priority policies of Parliament and the entire European Union . 
in writing . - I voted against the measure for Cooperation in vocational education and training to support the Europe 2020 strategy as I am fearful of any organisation that divides opinion having access and influence over minds . 
There is a large enough percentage of the EU population who consider themselves Eurosceptic for it to be deemed inappropriate that Brussels be at the helm of education and training . 
Such activity could be deemed propaganda . 
Vocational education and training measures are absolutely essential for turning the European economy into a knowledge economy , in line with the Europe 2020 strategy objectives . 
This is why I fully support the recommendations made by this report , which highlight the importance of investment in vocational education and training for the European economy ' s future competitiveness . 
We need effective measures , complementing each other at national and European level , in order to achieve our objectives . 
There has been an alarming rise in the youth unemployment rate in the EU . 
This report sends out a clear message: vocational education and training are key factors in tackling youth unemployment . 
Clear strategies are needed to facilitate their inclusion in the labour market , which will encourage the correlation between education programmes and the demands of the labour market , so that it can take up the graduates . 
The required approach must put the emphasis on specific skills so as to facilitate integration into the labour market . 
Furthermore , due to the constant technological changes , employers have ever-increasing expectations with regard to employees ' qualifications . 
This is why ongoing training plays a key role in constantly adapting vocational qualifications to the demands of the economy . 
This can help people avoid being excluded from the labour market at some time during their career . 
The report as a whole is driven by the philosophy of linking vocational education and training to the needs of the market and of businesses within the EU 2020 strategy , a strategy which further erodes the social fabric and workers ' rights . 
Although there are some positive references to general principles of ' humanising work ' and promoting creativity and the need for accessible pathways from informal to formal learning , they are all stale dead letter which simply embellish a report which , in the final analysis , promotes neoliberalism in every procedure and at every stage of education and training , even at the highest level . 
For example , it calls on the Member States to support doctoral and post-doctoral programmes that will underpin competitiveness and to facilitate ' labour mobility ' , commonly known as job insecurity . 
Finally , one of the most important disadvantages of the report is that it calls for the Member States to ensure ' mutual recognition of certificates and diplomas among the Member States ' , thereby putting pressure on them to recognise diplomas from various Greek or foreign colleges as ' equivalent ' to a degree from a State university . 
That is why I voted against the report . 
There is currently a tragic situation in a number of Member States as regards unemployment rates , especially amongst young people , for whom the current rate of unemployment is double the general EU rate of unemployment . 
This is , therefore , one of Europe ' s most pressing problems . 
It is essential that the Member States adopt political strategies aimed at combating this problem that are based on the objectives set by the Europe 2020 strategy of reducing school drop-out rates to below 10% per year , and of enabling at least 40% of young people to complete higher education . 
These must be tackled with concrete , creative and effective measures . 
Unfortunately , I would say that the Europe 2020 strategy ' s ambitions are not visibly in harmony with the reality of budget restrictions , which have substantially cut funding for the main EU programmes in the area of education . 
I welcome the measures adopted by the Commission aimed at facilitating accessibility , transparency and comparability for the purposes of the recognition process within and among education systems . 
It is also important that the Member States start reforming their systems , and gear vocational education and training towards the true needs of the labour market . 
In an effort to encourage European cooperation to support the Europe 2020 strategy , I would like to give my full backing to three points highlighted in this report . 
Firstly , I strongly support the need to improve dialogue between the labour market and the educational system by increasing the number of traineeships available in businesses , in order to enable students to become actively involved in the business world and also to strengthen links between businesses and educational institutions with regard to vocational training . 
I also think it is a good idea to integrate educational systems more at international level , firstly , to ensure that people ' s qualifications are fully recognised , and secondly , to promote cross-border mobility projects . 
Finally , I fully agree with Parliament ' s suggestion to the Commission to make the necessary adjustments to the European Social Fund , Erasmus and the Lifelong Learning Programme in order to ensure that funding can be allocated to specific education and training projects , and to projects to tackle youth unemployment and gender discrimination , with more women being encouraged to take part in those projects . 
This report aims to strengthen measures of cooperation between Member States by encouraging vocational education and training that is mutually recognised , of a better quality , more geared towards the needs of the labour market and more accessible to all . 
This report also reminds us of the need for a strategy for the future of education and , above all , for guidance on all the professional needs that Europe will have in the near future . 
In particular , the report warns of the need for stronger links within the European education and training system; for a system in which transparency , and mutual recognition of skills and aptitudes are , in fact , a reality . 
It seems obvious to me that in an increasingly unified Europe in which mobility is a growing reality , the mutual recognition of qualifications is absolutely essential . 
However , this requires the transposition of Union legislation in these areas , as this report warns . 
In the face of this new situation in Europe , education and training is becoming the basis and tool for a successful future . 
Promoting mobility , entrepreneurship , creativity and innovation is an objective necessity and should be encouraged by the EU , as the report points out . 
I agree with this report and I voted for it . 
in writing . - I support this report , which calls on the Member States to ensure that people , at different times of life , have access to vocational education and training which is tailored to their needs that will facilitate and improve their participation in the labour market and in society more generally . 
Vocational education and training should be accessible , available and affordable at all times of life , regardless of the people ' s status on the labour market or of their income . 
In particular , in order to achieve a better social integration and greater social cohesion , this report urges Member States to create training opportunities specific to groups such as unemployed youth , ethnic minorities , vulnerable women and people with disabilities . 
The report also points out that financing opportunities should be widened , simplified , and made more readily available , using the funding currently provided under the European Social Fund , the Lifelong Learning Programme as a whole , and Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs . 
The fight against youth unemployment is one of the most urgent challenges for Europe . 
That is why the Member States must urgently adopt targeted strategies that take national specificities and needs into account . 
Learning methods should be more flexible and accessible on a lifelong basis . 
We need to expand the possibilities of acquiring experience abroad for all . 
Apprenticeships should also be better recognised . 
Education and vocational training should be treated as a long-term common political priority to enable European workers to adapt to the requirements of a changing economy . 
At a time when youth unemployment in Europe is twice that of the working population , the proposals in the Hirsch report are a useful contribution to the policy pursued by the governments of the 27 Member States to combat unemployment . 
Faced with the challenges that are an ageing population and the globalisation of our economy , we need to encourage the development of lifelong training programmes , particularly through the exchange of good practices between Member States , and improve young Europeans ' early training by encouraging partnerships between universities , research centres and companies . 
According to future estimates relating to employability and required diplomas , there are allegedly 15 . 6 million new jobs within the EU for graduates and 3 . 7 million for those with a secondary education qualification (source: Cedefop) . 
On the other hand , 12 million jobs are going to be cut for those with a lower level of qualification ! 
Faced with this inevitable catastrophe , the 2020 strategy had to aim at increasing the attractiveness of vocational education and training . 
The report calls for adopting an approach focused on results in terms of apprenticeships , improving the recognition of formal and informal apprenticeships , and setting up assistance centres and schemes for those apprentices who struggle the most . 
In the context of a post-crisis Europe that is recovering and growing , vocational education and training are of crucial importance . 
It is essential to give young Europeans the tools necessary for them to be able to compete in a globalised world and for them to be able to enter the labour market using their knowledge and skills . 
We cannot forget that youth unemployment figures are overwhelming throughout Europe . 
However , we should be aware that more training often does not correspond to more opportunities in the labour market . 
Cases of young graduates , with additional training and postgraduate training , but without a job and without prospects of finding one , are multiplying in the EU . 
Training must be geared towards the needs of the market and prepare young workers . 
In my opinion , this paradigm shift will be vital in stopping the growth of unemployment amongst younger people and in guaranteeing them a future with more possibilities . 
This report by Mrs Hirsch tackles the problem of European cooperation on vocational education and training to support the Europe 2020 strategy . 
The goals of the Europe 2020 strategy - smart , sustainable and inclusive growth - must be given immediate consideration . 
Although the current economic and financial situation does not seem favourable , we must be able to turn less favourable situations into opportunities . 
In an increasingly globalised world , we cannot confine ourselves to a given territory , but must cultivate mobility , flexibility and international experience . 
It is important that early training be of a high quality and that young people be able to choose to work in other countries . 
I voted for the report because I agree with its proposals . 
Of these , I should like to stress the need for new and diversified lifelong learning , which is crucial for better-quality work , particularly in the context of jobs , as well as the need to pay particular attention to young people , to women and to the disabled , as set out in the Europe 2020 strategy . 
This is yet another tedious repetition of the European Commission ' s standard rhetoric on issues of lifelong learning and promotion of mobility at EU level , which are considered the best guarantee of improving workers ' ' employability ' and ' adaptability ' . 
Vocational training is viewed here as a means of promoting ' entrepreneurship ' and of responding to the need to ' create an environment where enterprises can succeed , develop and grow ' , adding that ' to grow , they need a reduced tax burden and predictability so they can plan and make investments ' . 
It also believes that vocational training and lifelong learning must be geared more closely ' to the needs of the labour market and allow for entry into and mobility within it ' . 
The report ' s ideological framework suddenly becomes clear: the problem of employment is a problem for the individual and not an eminently social one , with the individual - and not society - having to solve it , whether by increasing their ' employability ' or by becoming an ' entrepreneur ' ; a tax system that is profit-friendly and , therefore , imposed mainly on workers and consumers; and education and training totally at the beck and call of capital . 
As for the rest , it does not examine the causes in depth , or seek solutions . 
This report repeats the European Commission ' s standard rhetoric on issues of lifelong learning and promotion of mobility at EU level , which are considered to be the best guarantee against unemployment , and the need for workers to improve their ' employability ' and ' adaptability ' , so as to organise the supply of education and training . 
However , the report fundamentally emphasises the role of vocational training in promoting entrepreneurship and the need to ' create an environment where enterprises can succeed , develop and grow ' , adding that ' to grow , they need a reduced tax burden and predictability so they can plan and make investments ' . 
It also believes that vocational training and lifelong learning must be geared more closely ' to the needs of the labour market and allow for entry into and mobility within it ' . 
In other words , what the report does is put education and training fully at the beck and call of European capitalism . 
Moreover , it fails to mention the social reasons that lead to early school drop-out , to a lack of access to higher education opportunities and to youth unemployment , just so as to mask the responsibility of the neoliberal policies promoted by large companies and financial institutions . 
We therefore consider this report unacceptable . 
It does not examine the causes in depth , or seek solutions . 
I firmly believe that professional education and training should be available and affordable on a lifelong basis , regardless of a person ' s position on the labour market or their income . 
Access to professional education should respond to the particular needs of individuals , and thus make it easier for them to find a job . 
It is necessary to create opportunities for specific groups in EU Member States , such as unemployed young people , ethnic minorities , vulnerable women , people with disabilities and others , in order to achieve better social integration and better social cohesion . 
Last but not least , extended , simplified and more accessible funding options would undoubtedly assist the successful implementation of the above aims . 
With this report , we are adding another element to the European strategy on youth policy . 
It is right to support the internationalisation of studies together with job flexibility among young workers in an increasingly competitive labour market . 
Europe ' s young people must be given the opportunity to compete with their contemporaries from the four corners of the globe . 
Youth unemployment figures cannot leave us indifferent . 
We should welcome this report , which emphasises the importance of the Europe 2020 strategy objectives: to combat youth unemployment through efficient and effective measures such as , for example , reducing the school drop-out rate to below 10% and ensuring that at least 40% of young people are educated to university level . 
However , this should not be a finishing line but a starting point: future priorities should be to establish links between universities and businesses and to bring back compulsory traineeships / apprenticeships funded by public or private bodies . 
We do not have much time to play with and we must act now . 
Otherwise , the legacy we leave to future generations will be a very heavy one . 
I welcome the adoption of this report which puts the challenges of vocational education and training back at the heart of the concerns of the European Union and its Member States . 
At a time of budget austerity , which is a direct consequence of the global crisis that has hit the European labour market hard , we need to consider our strategies for growth and employment , especially for young people , without losing sight of national differences and needs . 
Young people are the first victims of unemployment and are very prone to dropping out of school . 
This is why it is imperative to modernise curricula and training so that they are more closely tailored to the needs of our companies . 
These efforts should also be applied to the area of lifelong training and in promoting mobility . 
Achieving these objectives will only be possible if all stakeholders (European institutions , Member States , local and regional players) join forces . 
I welcomed this document because Europe needs to take action immediately , especially where young people are concerned: rising youth unemployment is one of Europe ' s most pressing challenges . 
It is not just that the unemployment rate is higher among young workers than among their adult counterparts: young people are also to be found more frequently in insecure temporary jobs with lower pay and less social security cover . 
Member States must adopt targeted political strategies to combat poverty , taking into account specific national circumstances and needs . 
The aims set out in the Europe 2020 strategy , namely , to reduce the school drop-out rate to below 10% and ensure that 40% of young people are educated to university level , must be tackled by means of specific , creative and effective measures . 
Vocational education and training have to be treated as a long-term common political priority , which can be translated into reality only with the participation and commitment of all stakeholders: as well as the EU institutions and the Member States , those involved at local and regional level must use their influence to make this happen . 
We must ensure that Europe ' s workers are able to adapt to the requirements of the economy . 
Policy makers must enable people to improve and broaden their skills . 
Instead of being viewed solely as a means of helping people to get better jobs , upskilling must give them the opportunity to shape the jobs of the future and , hence , contribute actively to an innovative economy . 
in writing . - I would like to welcome this report which draws attention to the necessity of broadening the system of vocational training in the EU since equal access to quality lifelong learning means better chances in the labour market and thereby contributes to fulfilment of the goals of the EU ' s 2020 strategy . 
Special emphasis must be put on preventing youth unemployment , for which it is necessary to harmonise training supply with labour-market demand , provide middle-term national and regional forecasts on expected labour demand and enable national education systems to be more effective in guaranteeing the attainment of those skills that are actively sought on the labour market . 
According to Cedefop , we can expect a 12 million decline in jobs available for low skilled or unskilled labour , which presages an increasing risk of poverty for the most vulnerable . 
In many cases , even those who finish school are unable to enter the labour market and therefore are more likely to engage themselves in casual work or work in the black economy . 
Consequently , they are unable to start a life on their own and often become an unbearable burden on households , creating a vicious circle of unsatisfactory education and joblessness . 
The motion for a resolution draws particular attention to the education of young people and highlights the need for practical training . 
Ensuring access to suitable education and appropriate courses is absolutely essential in order to make sure that people finishing school , university or vocational training have no trouble in finding employment in their chosen field . 
Let us emphasise that these should be jobs with good conditions and decent pay . 
According to forecasts , economic problems will not change the fact that employment levels are rising in the EU , and should not give rise to a reduction in funding for the EU ' s key programmes in the field of vocational education and training , such as the ' Lifelong Learning ' programme , for example . 
These funds should , in fact , be increased , so that everyone , regardless of their age , gender or location , has access to the same opportunities in terms of vocational education and careers . 
As shadow rapporteur for the Hirsch report on European cooperation in vocational education and training , I would like to explain why I voted in favour of adopting this report . 
In the current situation , when ageing societies , on the one hand , and an alarmingly high rate of unemployment among young people , on the other , mean that Europe is faced with very serious challenges , vocational education and training have a fundamental role to play . 
When endeavouring to secure future support for vocational education and training , we should therefore , at the same time , attach the greatest importance to monitoring the effectiveness of training and to an approach focused on achieving the goal of increasing employment levels and social integration . 
It is my belief that vocational education and training must be closely linked with the labour market , a characteristic feature of which is constant adaptation to economic , demographic and social changes . 
In my opinion , ensuring that the ESF is managed more flexibly and that this fund complements other European employment instruments and domestic measures is an extremely important issue . 
Finally , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on a successful and comprehensive report , and to thank her for her excellent cooperation . 
The objectives of the EU 2020 strategy include , in particular , reducing school drop-out rates to below 10% and ensuring that at least 40% of young generations obtain a qualification . 
These objectives pursue the European ambition , laid out for the first time in the Lisbon strategy , to make the Union the world ' s most competitive knowledge-based economy . 
That is why the Copenhagen process which , since 2002 , has been laying the foundations of greater cooperation in terms of the Member States ' policies with regard to vocational education and training , is particularly important . 
I voted for this resolution because it sets ambitious objectives to improve the European programmes for education and training . 
in writing . - (FR) I voted in favour of Mrs Hirsch ' s report . 
In order to face the economic challenges of the 21st century and , in particular , the growing competition of our trading partners , European systems for vocational education and training have an obligation to be more effective , more attractive and more reactive , in order to better prepare our fellow citizens to the jobs that need filling . 
We must therefore work towards tailoring these systems to the needs of the world of work . 
I think there is also a need to facilitate access to high quality work experience in Europe and , therefore , to preserve and strengthen the existing programmes aimed at increasing apprentices ' mobility . 
Setting up a real ' Erasmus for apprentices ' , that is the commitment I undertook during the 2009 European election campaign: this is about the young and the not so young , while putting a foot in the world of work and gaining work experience , having the opportunity to travel within Europe and having direct contact with the economic realities of our Internal Market . 
Finally , we should also simplify and improve the system for recognising vocational qualifications in Europe , in order to revive the Internal Market and provide our fellow citizens with the keys to enhanced professional mobility . 
in writing . - I voted for this report . 
The Europe 2020 strategy lists the key factors for smart growth (fostering knowledge , innovation and education , and promoting the digital society) , sustainable growth (more resource-efficient production going hand in hand with enhanced competitiveness) , and inclusive growth (increasing the employment rate , training , and eradicating poverty) . 
What is needed , as far as vocational education and training are concerned , is to take practical steps at EU level and in the Member States to breathe life into the strategy . 
Education is undoubtedly a complex , long-term process , the quality and , in particular , the results of which consequently influence the future careers of young people . 
This should not be forgotten . 
In this context , I would like to say that demand for professional competence in a whole range of areas and activities will grow with the development of modern new technologies and the establishment of higher quality and safety standards , thus creating a requirement for the more goal-oriented training of young people . 
I am talking , however , about high-quality education built on the concept of modern teaching elements , about education made attractive in a specific way and showing the need for a given field of education , with a view to other options for boosting qualifications . 
The education process should result in professionally trained young people who have a clear idea of growth prospects and , first and foremost , who exploit their acquired knowledge , expertise and ability in the activity for which they have been trained and have acquired a qualification , the area of activity they have mastered and in respect of which they have shown an inclination . 
The report on European cooperation in vocational education and training to support the Europe 2020 strategy satisfactorily identifies the objectives that we set ourselves a while ago with that very same strategy . 
Ongoing dialogue between the world of vocational training and education and the labour market is more necessary than ever today . 
The main challenge is precisely to ensure that the labour market meets the needs of new workers on an increasingly regular basis . 
The proper implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy is essential in order for Europe to get back to sustained and sustainable economic growth . 
Young people are a crucial element of the success of the Europe 2020 strategy . 
However , as is well-known , they are currently the ones suffering most from the crisis , not least with unemployment reaching extremely high levels: unemployment rates amongst young people are double those for all the other unemployed . 
In order to achieve this , there is a need for significant investment in the area of vocational education and training . 
In a globalised world , quality education and vocational training are the vital keys that every young person should have when entering the labour market . 
The world economy requires skills , flexibility , availability and knowledge of languages . 
Faced with these requirements , it is our duty as politicians to put in place strategies that ensure the following: • Learning centred on a specific outcome; • Teaching entrepreneurship; • Providing bridges for unqualified people who wish to find a job , in particular , through tailored education; • Simplifying the procedures for recognising foreign qualifications in order to encourage workers to be mobile; • Establishing a European framework that offers quality work placements throughout the EU; • Lifelong learning so as to enable workers to adapt to market conditions and company needs . • Promoting creativity as well as information and communication technologies . • Supporting female employment by helping to reconcile work and family life . 
in writing . - Vocational education and training should be accessible , available and affordable at all times of life , regardless of people ' s status on the labour market or of their income . 
It is necessary to create training opportunities for specific groups , such as unemployed youth , ethnic minorities , vulnerable women , people with disabilities , etc . , in order to achieve better social integration and greater social cohesion . 
Financing opportunities should be widened , simplified and made more readily available using the funding currently provided under the European Social Fund and the Lifelong Learning Programme . 
In my opinion , this initiative is very important and timely . 
I voted in favour . 
The world of work has undergone some major changes . 
While , in the past , a good education was a guarantee of a good job , these days , a higher education diploma or degree will not protect young people in particular from unemployment . 
In particular , it is becoming increasingly difficult to get a start in one ' s career . 
On the other hand , businesses are constantly complaining about the shortage of specialist staff , using this supposed shortage as an excuse to use cheap labour . 
The complete flexibility and mobility demanded , as well as the ' bucket ' prices being imposed on the labour market in the form of new working models like ' Mac-jobs ' , make it impossible for many people to establish a family and to achieve a reasonable work-life balance . 
Within the framework of the Europe 2020 strategy , it may make sense to support the mutual recognition of education and training . 
However , the success of the strategy depends on taking steps to deal with these problematic developments . 
In this sense , the report ' s call for rapid action in relation to youth unemployment is to be welcomed , although there is a lack of concrete detail . 
I have therefore abstained from voting . 
There are major challenges ahead in Europe ' s labour market . 
The younger generation is faced with the problem that good education alone is no guarantee of finding a good job . 
Worse still , it no longer even offers protection against unemployment . 
On the other hand , large businesses are complaining of a shortage of specialist staff , often a welcome excuse for employing people at low wage rates . 
This renders it impossible to establish a family or to find a reasonable work-life balance . 
The mutual recognition of education and training is the first step in the right direction . 
The report ' s call for action in the area of youth unemployment is also correct . 
However , simply calling for action is too vague . 
For that reason , I have abstained from voting . 
I voted in favour of this resolution because cooperation at European Union level in the field of vocational training is a very important factor for achieving the Europe 2020 goals and reducing the level of youth unemployment . 
I agree with the proposal that , in forming a vocational education and training system , every Member State should devote particular attention to low-skilled workers , migrants , people with disabilities and other socially vulnerable groups . 
Training programmes should be oriented to their needs and level of ability . 
Furthermore , we must promote closer cooperation among the Member States ' various education systems in order to guarantee the integration of young people and encourage lifelong learning and formal / informal training . 
To ensure that vocational training matches labour market needs , I feel that it is advisable to incorporate information about changes in the labour market into national education strategies and programmes . 
The Commission should play major role here , by providing information about the skills and needs of individual regions and changes in the EU labour market . 
Furthermore , it is very important to create a favourable business environment for companies that cooperate in developing and implementing vocational training programmes . 
I voted in favour of the report on European cooperation in vocational education and training because this issue occupies an important place in the Europe 2020 strategy with the aim of ensuring economic development . 
Cooperating in order to improve vocational education and training means reducing the youth unemployment rate , equipping workers with cognitive tools and providing greater and simplified funding opportunities . 
The current socio-economic context requires the ability to work in international set-ups; we therefore need to increase the opportunities for learning , given also the role of businesses , which increasingly need skilled staff with practical training experience whom they can put to work immediately and effectively . 
This own-initiative report , in which the competent drafting committee incorporated numerous proposals by the Committee on Culture and Education , aims to galvanise the EU and the Member States into achieving the objectives of the EU 2020 strategy , especially in the employment and training sector . 
Account is taken of specific challenges such as: the demand for ever-increasing qualifications by the labour market , which puts low-skilled jobs at risk , the spiralling increase in youth unemployment , which is over 30% in certain EU Member States , including Greece , and the failure on the part of the Member States to take adequate measures to achieve the targets set in the EU 2020 strategy (for example , to reduce the percentage of early school leavers to 10% and to increase the percentage of young people with a university education to 40%) . 
Alongside social protection for citizens with fewer skills or a low level of education , we urgently need investment in new skills , especially those required for jobs in strategic sectors as far as growth is concerned . 
This is a key point for Greece . 
European cooperation on vocational education and training to support the Europe 2020 strategy is essential . 
The possibility of learning and working in an international context is an important prerequisite for a successful working life in a globalised economy . 
There is a growing need for mobile , flexible employees with international experience . 
I agree with the rapporteur when she says that there is a need to breathe life into the Europe 2020 strategy . 
This process should start immediately with practical measures being adopted at EU level and in the Member States in the field of vocational education and training . 
All of these factors are reasons why I am voting in favour of this report . 
Indeed , we are obliged to put Europe ' s workers in a position to adapt to the requirements of the economy . 
As political decision makers , we must enable people to develop and broaden their skills . 
Personal skill development , in addition to helping people find better jobs , must also provide them with the opportunity to shape the jobs of the future and , hence , contribute actively to an innovative economy . 
In an increasingly globalised world , it is important for young people to be able to expand their education and training through mobility . 
The labour market increasingly requires mobile , flexible people with international experience . 
Despite the economic crisis , it is estimated that the European labour market will see steady growth over the next 10 years . 
That is why the EU has implemented the Europe 2020 strategy , which aims to focus greater attention on vocational education and training . 
More and more effort must be made to break down barriers , increase transparency and make for ease of comparison within and between education systems . 
The education sector should pay closer attention to labour market needs , call for a method of assessing the results of learning and improve the quality of its own standards so as to become more professional . 
Lastly , creativity , innovation and entrepreneurship should be encouraged , so that Europe ' s young people and workers can broaden their knowledge and thus adapt to the needs of the economy . 
In order to achieve these objectives and to ensure that vocational education and training continue to be a key political priority for everyone in the long term , I voted in favour of the proposal in question . 
The Europe 2020 strategy lists the key factors for smart , sustainable and inclusive growth (increasing the employment rate , training , and eradicating poverty) . 
What is needed , as far as vocational education and training are concerned , is to take practical steps at EU level and in Member States for putting the strategy into practice . 
Europe ' s workers must be able to adapt to the economy ' s requirements . 
Political decision makers must enable people to upgrade and broaden their skills . 
I call on Member States to monitor actions to facilitate the transition from school to working life by developing integrated careers guidance and advice programmes , to create better training opportunities for trainers and lay the foundations for a facilitative learning partnership , particularly at regional and local level . 
As far as vocational education and training are concerned , Member States need to take into consideration the individual needs of low-skilled workers , migrant learners , people belonging to ethnic minorities , women , the unemployed and people with disabilities . 
I call on Member States to support innovative activities , as well as doctoral and post-doctoral programmes , which will underpin competitiveness and sustainable economic growth . 
in writing . - One of the most pressing challenges in the current economic climate is that of youth unemployment . 
Not only is the unemployment rate higher among young workers than among the rest of the population , but young workers are often to be found in insecure temporary jobs with lower pay and weaker legal protection . 
It is vitally important we address this . 
The forecast by the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (Cedefop) of growth of 80 million new jobs by 2020 is welcome . 
It is worth noting that there will be a shift towards industrial and technological development and a corresponding shift away from low-skilled labour . 
These new jobs will require workers with high and intermediate level skills . 
Action needs to be taken quickly to ensure that adequately skilled workers are available to fill these positions . 
With that in mind we must ensure that our approach to learning is focused on results . 
We must provide young people with access to lifelong learning and to courses with practical training elements to enable them to take up these jobs and to grow and progress in their careers . 
I believe these changes to vocational education will benefit the economies of all Member States . 
On the one hand , Europe is experiencing increased unemployment among young people and the insecure and temporary nature of the jobs young people normally do . 
On the other , however , it is also clear that companies lack qualified professionals whose training is geared towards the duties they should be performing . 
It is therefore important to seek to bring job supply in line with demand using measures such as , for example , independent advice on vocational training , making funds available for supporting vocational training , and competition between establishments providing said training . 
Ultimately , the aim is for people to be able to find a better job , but also , as the explanatory statement says , for them to have ' the opportunity to shape the jobs of the future ' . 
Today , we voted during the plenary session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg on the report on European cooperation in vocational education and training to support the Europe 2020 strategy . 
In spite of the severe effects that the economic crisis is having on the European labour market , it can be assumed that employment growth in Europe will recover , at least gradually , over the next 10 years . 
As far as vocational education and training are concerned , the key factors listed in the Europe 2020 strategy for smart , sustainable and inclusive growth need to be translated into practical steps at European Union level and in the Member States . 
If the goals indicated in the Europe 2020 strategy are to be attained , vocational education and training have to be treated as a key priority of the European Union institutions and those involved at local and regional level . 
Mrs Hirsch ' s report embraces the Commission measures aimed at breaking down barriers , increasing transparency , and making for ease of comparison for the purposes of recognition within and between education systems , emphasising that it is important to ensure that education is geared more closely to the needs of the labour market , helping to boost creativity and innovation . 
The EU and the Member States should increase their efforts to encourage youth employment and reduce their unemployment rate , in particular , through improving the match between the training systems and the needs of the labour market . 
With the loss of 12 million low-skilled jobs in Europe by 2020 , and the need for longer working lives to preserve our social model in the face of the demographic challenge , it is also crucial , at the same time , to step up the efforts for improving lifelong training of workers in the course of their career . 
In this respect , the idea of putting in place incentive mechanisms intended for employers so that they encourage their employees to participate in training programmes , suggested by Mrs Hirsch in this report , sounds interesting . 
In addition , in order to combat unemployment among low-skilled people , as well as to promote the employment of senior citizens , it is imperative to encourage the recognition of national qualifications between the Member States , and to encourage certification by validating skills acquired through informal apprenticeship . 
in writing . - In favour . 
The possibility and ability to learn and work in an international context is a prerequisite for a successful working life in a globalised economy . 
There is a growing need for mobile , flexible employees with international experience . 
The Europe 2020 strategy lists the key factors for smart growth (fostering knowledge , innovation and education , and promoting the digital society) , sustainable growth (more resource-efficient production going hand in hand with enhanced competitiveness) , and inclusive growth (increasing the employment rate , training , and eradicating poverty) . 
What is needed , as far as vocational education and training are concerned , is to take practical steps at EU level and in the Member States to breathe life into the strategy . 
In spite of the severe effects that the economic crisis is having on the European labour market , it can be assumed that employment growth in Europe will recover , at least gradually , over the next ten years . 
According to Cedefop ' s current Europe-wide skill supply and demand forecast , the number of new jobs up to 2020 is estimated at 80 million . 
The possibility and ability to learn and work in an international context is a prerequisite for a successful working life in an ever more globalised economy . 
Industry is increasingly calling for education and training offerings to be related directly to practical requirements and oriented towards solutions . 
What matters is that those who have completed a vocational education or training course should bring their newly acquired abilities and skills to the working environment . 
The resolution adopted today is a first step towards ensuring that Europe ' s workers are put in a position to adapt to the requirements of the economy . 
People must be given the means to upgrade and broaden their skills . 
Instead of being viewed solely as a means of helping people to get better jobs , upskilling must give them the opportunity to shape the jobs of the future and , hence , contribute actively to an innovative economy . 
Education , vocational training and also the universal idea of ' lifelong learning ' are the building blocks for the future of European integration , which is coming up against ever-new challenges in respect of support for the Europe 2020 strategy . 
We must face up to the fact that the level of unemployment among young people is increasing at an alarming rate . 
Problems associated with vocational education and training are becoming a priority for us . 
People at the start of their professional careers may find that unemployment has a negative effect on their further activity in the labour market . 
Vocational education and training make it possible to move around freely within the labour market , according to the changing economic situation and the demands of a particular economic sector . 
It is worth highlighting the usefulness and merits of existing cross-border educational programmes , for example , the Leonardo Da Vinci programme , which deserve our support . 
They make it possible for individuals to acquire the qualities which are characteristic of a mobile workforce . 
Mobility eliminates the difficulties which arise as a result of the natural diversity of the individual labour markets , and provides young workers with access to the enormous European labour market , full of new challenges and opportunities to make use of the experience they have gained . 
The Member States are faced with the task of facilitating supervision and assistance in respect of the establishment of cooperation and the exchange of information between schools , training institutions , research centres and businesses . 
Young workers bring new reserves of knowledge , skills and experience to the EU labour market . 
in writing . - I support this report . 
However , I believe the scale of the cuts to the lifelong learning programme and the People programme is unacceptably severe . 
The fight against youth unemployment must be a priority for all European governments . 
We need to provide European young people with a full , attractive and competitive offer in terms of training and education , one that enables them to find a job more easily . 
In particular , I believe that vocational education and lifelong learning should thus be more in tune with the needs of the labour market . 
Furthermore , higher education should be combined with vocational training by giving priority , for instance , to a mix of training and work . 
Consequently , I voted in favour of the Hirsch report . 
Youth unemployment in Europe is at 21% and currently affects more than 5 . 5 million young Europeans , who are at risk of social exclusion because of a lack of opportunities and are forced to accept insecure jobs . 
Training and education are the major challenges the European Union is currently facing , enshrined in the Europe 2020 strategy . 
The goals have been set of reducing the school drop-out rate to below 10% and enabling 40% of young people to complete higher education by 2020 . 
These are fairly ambitious targets , but they are necessary for economic growth and for making the Member States more competitive , thereby creating jobs . 
I voted for this report , since I think it is essential to have a long-term , EU-level strategy that also enables structural unemployment and youth unemployment to be tackled . 
To this end , I think it is important to continue supporting small and medium-sized enterprises , since they create 50% of jobs , and to invest in continuous , lifelong learning . 
Finally , I should like to mention the need to recognise vocational qualifications , thereby facilitating the increased mobility of professionals and students . 
Combating youth unemployment is one of the most important challenges facing the EU . 
In order to address this problem , we need to invest more in the education and training of young people so that they are equipped for future challenges on the labour market , which is becoming more and more demanding . 
The report also quite rightly states that the European Social Fund could contribute more towards the education of the financially weak . 
Especially important , as I personally have stated on several occasions , is the proposal to facilitate labour mobility within the framework of the Internal Market . 
European cooperation to draft a single policy is needed in this sector . 
For all these reasons , I supported this particular report . 
The mismatch between young people ' s qualifications and the needs of the labour market is one of the reasons why Lithuania has such a terribly high rate of youth unemployment (34%) . 
In 2010 , 52% of all unemployed young people (50 000) who registered with the Lithuanian Labour Exchange did not have any vocational training . 
The inability of my country ' s young people to find suitable work has caused a huge wave of youth emigration - in the last few years , 50% of Lithuanian emigrants were aged 20-34 . 
The need for a mobile and flexible workforce is growing and therefore , we must help Europe ' s workforce to adapt to the needs of the economy , giving them the opportunity to improve their skills and enhance their knowledge . 
It is important for vocational training to be accessible to all people . 
I am pleased that the rapporteur understands this . 
ESF funding could be invaluable , helping to provide training for neglected groups in Lithuanian society . 
The time has also come for the EU to use effective and creative measures to implement the aims set out in the Europe 2020 strategy , such as reducing the school drop-out rate to under 10% and ensuring that 40% of young people are educated to university level . 
in writing . - Both young and old people alike should have access to vocational education and training . 
For example , both the Lifelong Learning and People schemes provide invaluable opportunities to those who want to learn new skills and find new jobs . 
Current unemployment levels , particularly among young people , are worrying and more needs to be done to ensure that young people are able to gain vital skills and qualifications . 
I strongly believe that the ESF has a valuable role to play in training and educating people . 
It is important that those on lower incomes receive financial support to help them attend training courses , which would , in turn , give them more opportunity to fully integrate themselves in the labour market . 
The Europe 2020 strategy should provide for smart , sustainable and inclusive growth . 
A results-based approach is also essential in relation to learning . 
 ' Lifelong learning ' is an absolute priority for our citizens , which is why access to vocational education and training must be a priority for us . 
I am voting for this report . 
It assesses the financing instrument for development cooperation (DCI) , but I note the importance of the mechanism that should succeed it this year . 
I agree with the rapporteur ' s criticisms of the fact that the scrutiny work carried out by Parliament was not acknowledged by the representatives of the Member States or the DCI Committee . 
I voted in favour of this Regulation (EC) No 1905 / 2006 establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation: lessons learned and perspectives for the future . 
2011 is a strategic moment to draw lessons from four years of operation of Regulation (EC) No 1905 / 2006 establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation (DCI) . 
Further simplification and adaptation to new challenges , such as climate change , as well as determining the external dimension of the EU ' s internal policies , are important aspects that must be taken into consideration . 
I agree with the provision set out in the resolution that the future instrument for supplying EU development aid must be adequately equipped in financial terms . 
The EU has committed itself to the collective target of spending 0 . 7% of its Gross National Income (GNI) on Official Development Assistance (ODA) by 2015 . 
The current level of European aid will have to increase significantly to achieve this aim . 
Coordination and division of labour must be the guiding principles of programming under the new development instrument . 
The idea of European strategy documents should be pursued as a matter of high priority , and the European Parliament must be actively involved in this process . 
Parliament must have the opportunity to defend the specificity of the EU ' s development policy in the post-2013 development cooperation instrument by scrutinising strategic programming decisions on an equal footing with the Council . 
The Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) is one of the European Union ' s extremely altruistic projects , intended to provide assistance to developing countries without any conditions or ulterior interests . 
The lack of any utilitarian aspect to the EU ' s involvement must force its institutions to target these funds much better and focus on eradicating poverty and complying with the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) . 
I must stress the need for greater transparency for all funds earmarked for this purpose and , more importantly , for increasing the assessments of the impact which the DCI has among the population in those countries . 
This is because these funds must be backed up by effective social policies implemented in developing countries . 
These funds must be , in the medium and long term , the ' rod ' which the relevant peoples will use to learn to ' fish ' and successfully become self-sufficient . 
We must not forget that 2010 was the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion . 
This is precisely why the Development Cooperation Instrument must continue this fight in developing countries as well , by making a significant contribution to guaranteeing a decent living for as many citizens as possible . 
in writing . - The purpose of this report on the establishment of a financial instrument for development cooperation is to set at an early stage a Parliament position on this topic . 
This position should be based on the lessons drawn from its scrutiny of the implementation of our development cooperation . 
I appreciated the method followed by the rapporteur in evaluating the outcome and modalities of the EU cooperation for development . 
The rapporteur clearly states that , in spite of the constructiveness of the dialogue with the Commission , the Commission itself did not change its behaviour in development matters as Parliament recommended . 
Parliament ' s position was only sporadically reflected in the draft implementing measures submitted by the Commission to the DCI management committee . 
This is partially understandable . 
The main partner of the rapporteur was DG RELEX , whose main mandate is the promotion of EU interests in the rest of the world . 
But development cooperation is the one policy area of external action (besides humanitarian aid) which is not designed to serve EU interests , but to defend the interests of the most vulnerable populations of this planet . 
Since the position expressed in this report fully reflects this global inspiration , I was glad to vote in favour of it . 
I supported Mr Mitchell ' s report because I believe we have to increase the participation of parliaments in developing countries when drawing up strategy papers for these countries , for the poverty eradication strategy for instance . 
Moreover , European development aid must be adequately funded . 
The European Union has pledged to devote 0 . 7% of its Gross National Income (GNI) to Official Development Assistance (ODA) by 2015 , which will mean increasing the current amount of European aid . 
The Millennium Development Goals deadline falls within the duration of the first financing instrument for development cooperation . 
Therefore , the ongoing cooperation with local authorities must be expanded and their role in combating poverty and hunger , improving water and health services , and encouraging local economic development must be developed . 
Security of food supply , the challenges of the agricultural sector and feed production , and the cost of living crisis must be addressed when the financing instruments and broad policy for cooperation and collaboration for development are being created . 
I welcome what is said on that subject in the report . 
I agree that the Commission should conduct a comprehensive analysis of the general budgetary support , containing details of the support being given to particular sectors , to particular projects , and to local governments . 
That information would help in the future when efforts are being made to allocate resources and funding more efficiently , and consequently would allow any problems in the distribution system to be identified . 
A more consistent policy would result from this . 
The overarching objective of development cooperation is the eradication of poverty in partner countries , including pursuit of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) . 
To achieve these objectives , the EU needs a specific financing instrument for development cooperation . 
The Commission has committed itself to presenting a legislative proposal for the financing instruments for external action later this year , and to reconsidering the overall structure of the external financing instruments when debating the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) . 
I voted in favour of this document , which establishes Parliament ' s position with regard to a new financing instrument for EU development cooperation . 
I agree that the future instrument for supplying EU development aid must be adequately equipped in financial terms , given the commitments made by the EU in this field to spend 0 . 7% of its Gross National Income (GNI) on Official Development Assistance by 2015 . 
I voted against the motion for a European Parliament resolution on establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation with developing countries , areas and regions because of the wish expressed by the motion in respect of the management of illegal immigration . 
In particular , it maintains that development funds for migration should not be used for strengthening border management and combating illegal immigration . 
This position is incompatible with our political approach in which strengthening borders and combating illegal immigration are key priorities , and therefore we would argue that additional resources should be invested in this direction . 
I therefore decided to vote against the motion . 
The issue of development cooperation is one of the cardinal principles underpinning my work . 
I believe that the excellent report by Mr Mitchell successfully highlights the areas in which Europe could and should do better . 
The experience of the financing instrument for development cooperation (DCI) has been fundamental in understanding how the European Union should proceed in the context of the next Multiannual Financial Framework . 
If we want to make financing instruments effective , then we need to set up financing that is independent of other measures , recalculate quotas , and review how instruments are implemented . 
This review must be based on a Neighbourhood Policy that is sensitive to the range of needs of poorer countries and no longer just to the interests of Europe . 
I firmly believe that EU development policy must be the result of work by both Parliament and the Council , and that Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should also apply to this issue . 
These principles have been clearly stated in the report in question , and I therefore voted in favour . 
I welcome the adoption of Mr Mitchell ' s report which is aimed at establishing Parliament ' s position in relation to the new financing instrument designed to regulate the European Union ' s development cooperation , based on the lessons learned from implementing the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) (the financing instrument for development cooperation) . 
In this respect , I should like to point out that high levels of poverty remain in the developing countries , territories and regions and that we need to increase the funds devoted to the causes of poverty , in particular , malnutrition , health problems , education , access to drinking water , instead of moving towards systems for regulating immigration which come under other financial schemes . 
Development aid must enable the populations concerned to remain in their geographical area . 
Regulating immigration must be done through another financial instrument and must lead to increased resources for FRONTEX . 
That was the logic behind my voting for this report . 
To begin with , I should like to welcome the efforts that have been made by the European Union to eradicate poverty in developing countries . 
International cooperation aimed at promoting these countries ' self-sufficiency and independence is the right path towards achieving social and political peace at international level , which will not only fundamentally affect the beneficiary populations , but will also lead to the resolution of Europe ' s immigration problems . 
I therefore support increased European funding for this cause , as well as the creation of a financial instrument focused exclusively on it . 
In the context of the debate on the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) post-2013 , it is particularly important to redefine and reinforce the positions Parliament has adopted on a new financing instrument for EU development cooperation (DCI) , given the lessons learned from implementing the DCI during the period 2007-2013 . 
To begin with , I consider it essential that this new instrument continue to prioritise achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) . 
In order to achieve this aim - specifically , the eradication of poverty - it is essential that any future instrument be provided with realistic and adequate financial resources . 
The Commission should ensure that EU aid is consistent with development goals and targets set at international level . 
I would also reiterate the importance of how thoroughly eligibility criteria for countries benefiting from funding from this future instrument are applied . 
I would like to stress that the new DCI should provide a basis for targeted and more flexible aid in situations of fragility . 
I believe it should help to ensure proper linkage of relief , rehabilitation and development operations . 
In conclusion , I would congratulate Mr Mitchell on the report he has tabled and I support the suggestions it includes . 
In recent decades , numerous aid programmes have been carried out in developing countries by a variety of public and private organisations . 
As the report shows , the low levels of success achieved to date , lack of coordination with regard to shared objectives (World Health Organisation) , and lack of clear indications as to how such objectives should be achieved make it necessary , in my view as well , to introduce a new financing instrument for development cooperation . 
However , this instrument must be intelligently designed , and must be such that it improves the current situation without leading to further waste of resources . 
If this project is to be truly effective , action must be taken on two fronts . 
Firstly , given that the primary objective is the elimination of poverty , genuinely new funds must be allocated to the cause: funds must not be taken away from projects that are already ongoing . 
Secondly , I believe that the European Union needs to commit itself more wholeheartedly to this project . 
Coordinating and sharing tasks need to be the guiding principles for orienting planning in respect of the new development instrument . 
The purpose of this report is to establish Parliament ' s preliminary position with regard to a new financing instrument for EU development cooperation (DCI) , based on the previous regulation . 
I believe Parliament ' s involvement at the early stages of the redesign of this instrument will be of great value to it , so I am supporting this initiative . 
I believe the values that characterise European Parliament action , not least the promotion of democracy and the defence of human rights , can contribute positively to constructing a tool that is more compact , effective and comprehensive . 
In my opinion , the way the report analyses this issue is quite interesting: it proposes new approaches that will now have to be debated over the coming months , specifically as regards the need for aid to developing countries that is more differentiated , dividing them into groups . 
It also demonstrates the need for reliable and consistent retrospective analysis work in this area , proposing a new approach to development aid based on greater differentiation , on the involvement of civil society , and on strict eligibility criteria . 
Now that the financing instrument for development cooperation (DCI) has been in place for four years , it is time to assess how it has been operating , in order to improve future financial instruments for this area . 
It is now evident that there is a need for Parliament to maintain democratic scrutiny of this financial instrument and future ones; it is even clearer how important it is becoming for developing countries ' national parliaments to be involved in drafting strategic national documents linked to aid received from the Union . 
I hope that aid levels will not decrease , but rather will increase wherever possible , and that ways for it to effectively benefit the most deprived populations will be studied . 
Throughout this process , the crucial role that should be attributed to civil society in developing countries cannot be stressed enough . 
The situations in developing countries should not all be approached in the same way , but rather in a more differentiated way , bearing in mind that traditional financial aid can become less important in many cases , for example , in the case of the so-called emerging countries . 
This report , drafted by Mr Mitchell , concerns Regulation (EC) No 1905 / 2006 establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation: lessons learned and perspectives for the future . 
Regulation (EC) No 1905 / 2006 has been in force for four years and it is time to analyse it and learn from any potential errors and / or shortcomings that may exist , since the Commission is aiming to submit proposals before the summer relating to the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for the post-2013 period . 
I support the rapporteur ' s proposals - not least , achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) , the eradication of poverty , the channelling of 20% of resources into health and primary education , particular attention to climate issues , a new approach to aid in developing countries that demands respect for human rights , and the more efficient and effective use of scarce resources - so I voted in favour . 
The report evaluates the financing instrument for development cooperation (DCI) , four years after the regulation that implemented it came into force . 
The evaluation carried out is relevant from several points of view . 
Opportune and critical analyses are made of DCI and the EU ' s development cooperation policy , which we consider fair and necessary . 
The report states that the purpose of development policy should not be to defend the EU ' s interests , but rather those of the most vulnerable populations on the planet; it draws attention to the excessive focus on investments to be made by the private sector , as well as the constraints imposed on the public sector; it warns of the need for funds not to be diverted from already underfinanced sectors , giving the example of support for local authorities; it criticises any attempt to cut the funding of the DCI and the European Development Fund; and it stresses once again that not enough progress has been made with the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) and that there is a need to increase Official Development Assistance (ODA) . 
Nevertheless , we believe the report could and should have gone further on each of these points , especially in advocating consistency between the goals stated in the area of development cooperation policy and the EU ' s various sectoral policies . 
The report evaluates the financing instrument for development cooperation (DCI) , four years after the regulation that implemented it came into force . 
The evaluation carried out is relevant from several points of view . 
Opportune and critical analyses are made of DCI and the EU ' s development cooperation policy , which we consider fair and necessary . 
For example , the report states that the purpose of development policy should not be to defend the EU ' s interests , but rather those of the most vulnerable populations on the planet . 
It draws attention to the excessive focus on investments to be made by the private sector , as well as the constraints imposed on the public sector , and warns of the need for funds not to be diverted from already underfinanced sectors , giving the example of support for local authorities . 
It also criticises any attempt to cut the funding of the DCI and the European Development Fund , and stresses once again that not enough progress has been made with the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) and that there is a need to increase Official Development Assistance (ODA) . 
Nevertheless , we believe the report could and should have gone further , on each of these points , especially in advocating consistency between the goals stated in the area of development cooperation policy and the EU ' s various sectoral policies . 
The report examines the effectiveness of the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) in relation to the debate on the Multiannual Financial Framework . 
A reassessment of the overall structure of external funding instruments appears to be appropriate . 
Important aspects that should be considered include possible further simplification , adaptation to new challenges such as climate change , and also the right place for the external dimension of the EU ' s internal policies . 
In my opinion , it is equally important to establish the procedures and structures which will protect development as an independent area of policy with its own specific objectives . 
I welcome Mr Mitchell ' s report . 
The purpose of the report is to establish the European Parliament ' s position with regard to future financing for development cooperation prior to publication of the post-2013 Multiannual Financial Framework . 
In future , sufficient funds must always be available for EU development cooperation . 
The policy of development aid is neither an altruistic obligation , nor a means for former colonial powers of easing their consciences , where there has been colonisation . 
It is , in its own right , one of the branches of foreign policy; however , it should also be an important part in a strategy for reversing migratory flows that enables populations to remain in or return to their country of origin and live life there with dignity and increasing prosperity . 
Since these two areas fall within the sovereignty of states , most of the institutional and financial requirements of the Mitchell report are not acceptable . 
I welcomed the report because 2011 is a strategic moment to draw lessons from four years of operation of Regulation (EC) No 1905 / 2006 establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation (DCI) . 
The purpose of this report is to establish at an early stage Parliament ' s position with regard to a new financing instrument for EU development cooperation , based on the lessons drawn from our scrutiny of the implementation of the DCI . 
I agreed that a differentiated approach to the diverse group of developing countries is needed , and that traditional financial aid may become less relevant for emerging countries . 
I believe that aid for emerging countries , while promoting sustainable economic growth , should still focus on reinforcing the partner country ' s fiscal policy and promoting mobilisation of domestic revenue which should lead to the reduction of poverty and aid dependence . 
We must refrain from using budget support in countries where transparency in public spending cannot be assured . 
Budget support must always be accompanied by actions to develop the receiving country ' s parliamentary control and audit capacities and to increase transparency and public access to information , and civil society should be involved in monitoring budget support . 
I believe that the Mitchell report , which is an extremely good report , touches on many key issues , and I therefore decided to vote in favour of it . 
I believe that what matters most when considering the future shape of financing instruments for development is to remember that the overriding aim of development policy should be to reduce dependence on aid gradually , and for the country in question ultimately to achieve total independence . 
In connection with this , financing instruments should be designed in such a way as to ensure long-term economic growth in developing countries . 
Achievement of this goal is closely linked to how predictable development aid is , since it is only on the basis of such aid , at the same time as mobilising domestic revenues , that partner countries can construct an adequate and effective development strategy . 
In my opinion , a further crucial issue is that of increasing the European Parliament ' s control and influence over the European Development Fund . 
I believe that the lack of democratic control over this fund is detrimental to the transparency of development policy . 
I voted in favour of adopting this report . 
Funding for development cooperation requires well-thought-out regulations , and the report provides a synthesis of what our priorities should be when adopting them . 
The goals pursued by the European Union when establishing this instrument are to ensure special EU assistance for developing countries . 
In view of our current struggle to cope with the financial crisis , the problems of poorer countries are becoming ever more evident . 
The financing instrument for development cooperation is aimed at helping poorer partner countries in the field of trade and regional integration , the natural environment and the management of natural resources , infrastructure , water and energy , rural development , agriculture and food security , human development and social cohesion . 
Furthermore , we want to support the development of government systems , democracy , human rights and also economic and institutional reforms , and to prevent conflicts and weakening of the state . 
All the abovementioned goals are of the utmost importance in terms of strengthening security in poorer regions . 
Helping other countries to construct stable democratic societies in countries governed by the rule of law , where human rights are observed and freedom of speech is guaranteed , with a solid judicial system , territorial defence and armed forces , is a commendable plan . 
I hope that we will succeed in putting it into effect on a wider scale , making even more efficient use of funds . 
in writing . - The future instrument for supplying EU development aid must be adequately equipped in financial terms . 
The EU has committed itself to the collective target of spending 0 . 7% of its GNI on ODA by 2015 . 
To reach this aim , the current level of European aid will have to significantly increase . 
Given the added value of Commission aid , and the Commission ' s new role in coordinating the Union ' s and the Member States ' development policy (Article 210 TFEU) , the share of ODA channelled through the EU budget should remain at least stable . 
The annual figures for the new development cooperation instrument in the next MFF period should significantly increase in real terms . 
It is time to assess how the financing instrument for development cooperation (DCI) has been used , now that it has been in place for four years . 
That is the only way we will be able to improve it to make it more effective in the future . 
It is important that Parliament have something to say as regards its scrutiny of this and future financial instruments . 
Despite the economic crisis we are experiencing , it is important to maintain these instruments for aiding developing countries so that they may be able , in the near future , to increase their levels of wealth , with the inherent improvement in the living conditions of the populations in these so-called emerging countries . 
The upcoming instrument for funding development cooperation will have to have sufficient amounts at its disposal at the end of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) . 
Donor countries should respect their commitment to set aside 0 . 7% of their GDP to Official Development Assistance (ODA) by 2015 . 
As I have already said , nothing justifies a reduction in aid . 
Official Development Assistance currently represents more than USD 120 billion . 
We can do more and better . 
However , doing more and doing better is not just a case of increasing resources . 
The inclusion of the European Development Fund (EDF) in the budget would be significant progress as long as it does not lead to a reduction in total funding amounts at EU level . 
I am also in favour of ' more ' budgetary aid , whether general or sector-specific , and fewer projects whenever the macro-economic and governance criteria allow . 
Firstly , it would make it possible to mobilise financial resources quickly in order to rebuild or consolidate the State . 
Secondly , it is the only kind of aid for which we can be sure that it will be absorbed in an optimal way . 
Finally , I believe that we need to ensure that this aid is more effective . 
in writing . - EU principles of rendering assistance to developing countries which are not covered by the Cotonou Agreement or by the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument are very important . 
In terms of this financial instrument , it is possible to render financial aid to ACP countries (African , Caribbean and Pacific Group of States) in restructuring the manufacturing of sugar , and financial support for five programmes is envisioned: food security; environment and sustainable development of natural resources , including energy; migration and asylum granting; investment in human resources; the role of local authorities and non-governmental organisations in development processes . 
I voted in favour . 
The fostering of prosperity in so-called developing countries is a necessary measure , particularly in order to prevent a tidal wave of migrants flooding into Europe . 
At present , this is being managed through a variety of programmes . 
However , the aim of this report is to increase financial aid . 
This is something I cannot support . 
In view of the present financial difficulties within the EU , we cannot provide this aid at the moment . 
Furthermore , it is the Member States and not the EU that should determine how development aid is to be used . 
The idea of giving developing countries a helping hand and (also) offering them financial support is something to be warmly welcomed . 
Humanitarian principles and the desire for global balance provide plausible grounds for this . 
The European Union already provides help within the framework of a variety of programmes . 
Nonetheless , this report plans to establish more instruments , thereby expanding development aid . 
However , in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity , development aid payments should be a matter for the individual states . 
Development cooperation is the only external action policy which defends the most marginalised and vulnerable groups of society . 
The Commission must make every effort to ensure that appropriate and sufficient aid is allocated to the development of the domestic private sector and small- and medium-sized enterprises in low income countries . 
Particular attention must be paid to migration . 
It is important to ensure that money earmarked to combat illegal immigration is used as it was specifically intended . 
Attention should also be drawn to the fact that , when establishing a new financing instrument for developing countries alone , there must be a thorough analysis of the general objectives , the priority areas and expected results , as well as the allocation of funds . 
2011 is a strategic moment to draw lessons from the four years of operation of Regulation (EC) No 1905 / 2006 establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation (DCI) . 
The Commission has announced that it will present its proposals for the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for the post-2013 period before the summer recess and the legislative proposals for the financing instruments for external action later this year . 
The purpose of this report - which I am voting for - is to establish at an early stage Parliament ' s position with regard to a new financing instrument for EU development cooperation , based on the lessons drawn from our scrutiny of the implementation of the DCI over the last four years . 
I would stress the need for the following broad areas to be promoted: adequate funding within the available resources; the effect of poverty eradication and Official Development Assistance (ODA) criteria; geographic and thematic programmes; procedures for programming EU aid , with better coordination and division of labour; and bridging the democracy gap , with Parliament being called on to take part in the decision-making process . 
Regulation (EC) No 1905 / 2006 establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation has been in operation for four years now . 
The Commission will soon present its proposals for the post-2013 Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) and the legislative proposals for the financing instruments for external action later this year . 
The purpose of this report is to establish at an early stage Parliament ' s position with regard to a new financing instrument . 
The report presents the lessons learned , with a particular focus on the experience gained by the European Parliament during its democratic scrutiny of the implementation of the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) . 
Part of the report is dedicated to perspectives for the future and finally , the report looks at geographic and thematic programmes , insisting on strict eligibility criteria for budget support , emphasising the important role that civil society plays in development and the application of the delegated acts procedure for those decisions which fulfil the criteria of Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) . 
I voted in favour of this motion so that the European Parliament has the possibility to exercise scrutiny over strategic programming decisions on an equal footing with the Council . 
As four years have passed since Regulation (EC) No 1905 / 2006 came into force , and as the Commission has already announced the tabling of proposals relating to the Multiannual Financial Framework for the post-2013 period , there is a need for a brief analysis of the results achieved since then and of future means of development . 
The most important thing to stress is that this is ' the one policy area of external action [ . . . ] which has not been designed to serve EU interests , but to defend the interests of the most marginalised and vulnerable populations of this planet ' . 
As such , Parliament should take on a more important role , not just because of the various ways that this confers democratic legitimacy , but also because of what it can offer in material and procedural terms . 
It should also be stressed that the objective should be the eradication of poverty , by reference to the concept of ' basic social services ' , so as to seek to reduce the situation of extreme vulnerability of the most deprived populations . 
in writing . - In favour . 
2011 is a strategic moment to draw lessons from the four years Regulation (EC) No 1905 / 2006 establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation (DCI) has been in operation . 
The Commission has announced that it will present its proposals for the post-2013 Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) before the summer recess and the legislative proposals for the financing instruments for external action later this year . 
The purpose of this report is to establish at an early stage Parliament ' s position with regard to a new financing instrument for EU development cooperation , based on the lessons drawn from our scrutiny of the implementation of the DCI . 
The purpose of the report adopted today is to establish Parliament ' s position with regard to a new financing instrument for European Union development cooperation , based on the lessons drawn from our scrutiny of the implementation of the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) . 
Contrary to Parliament , Member States did not seem to focus on checking the compliance of Commission proposals with the legal provisions of the DCI . 
It should be clarified , therefore , that development cooperation is the only EU external action policy which has not been designed to serve European Union interests , but to defend the interests of the most marginalised and vulnerable populations on this planet through poverty alleviation and sustainable human , social and economic development - in short , the right to a decent life for all . 
Parliament clearly recognises the importance of these activities and therefore calls for an instrument which would enable the European Union to finance such actions from sources other than the DCI . 
I voted in favour of Mr Mitchell ' s report because it defines essential and correct directions for the future adoption and operation of the financing instrument for development cooperation by learning useful lessons from the use currently being made of this development cooperation tool . 
EU funds for development cooperation are a real mechanism for combating poverty and promoting democratisation and development in developing countries . 
Under the Treaty of Lisbon , the EU has enhanced powers of international representation and is being called on to respond to challenges such as climate change , combating poverty and transferring the rule of law and democratic values to developing countries . 
I agree with the rapporteur that the democratic accountability of all EU development policy and the active role which Parliament must have in the procedure for approving funds for development aid , based on Article 290 of the Treaty of Lisbon , need to be enhanced . 
in writing . - I support this report , which draws on the instrument ' s performance , scrutiny and promoting better use of development money in the future . 
I voted in favour of the Mitchell report because we need to learn the lessons of the last four years of using Regulation (EC) No 1905 / 2006 establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation (DCI) . 
On this occasion , the objectives and scope for this development aid must be very clearly defined . 
Migration is an area where we need to give priority to the coherence of policies promoting development . 
Thus , development aid should finance projects aimed at tackling the deep-rooted causes of migration (fighting against poverty) , but it should not be used to improve border control or combat illegal immigration . 
I voted in favour of the text presented by Mr Mitchell . 
In view also of the lessons learned from the implementation of the development cooperation instrument ahead of the introduction of the new post-2013 instrument , I believe that Parliament should have the possibility to defend the specificity of the EU ' s development policy by scrutinising strategic programming decisions on an equal footing with the Council . 
Furthermore , it is particularly important for decisions on the general objectives , the priority areas and the allocation of funds to be taken using the delegated acts procedure , pursuant to Article 290 TFEU . 
I am voting for this report because the amendments introduced by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament (S&D) were included in the compromise text . 
These include key points such as general guidelines , the potential for improvement at Commission level and the potential for improvement at Parliament level . 
I voted in favour of this resolution on guaranteeing independent impact assessments . 
I agree with the rapporteur that impact assessments (IAs) are a key instrument in the legislative process , and one which European legislators should make greater use of in future . 
IAs show legislators the possible consequences of their policy options and help them make a decision . 
IAs can thus make a significant contribution to better law making . 
However , they can in no way be a substitute for political debate and the legislator ' s democratic and legitimate decision-making process . 
It should be pointed out that IAs merely contribute to the preparation of the specific content of a political decision . 
It is important for IAs to be completely independent and transparent and , moreover , the consequences for small and medium-sized enterprises should be taken into account . 
Parliament already has the power to issue its own IAs and submit Commission IAs to thorough scrutiny . 
Hitherto , however , this procedure has rarely been applied . 
I agree with the position set out in the resolution that the European Parliament should make greater use of the powers it has been given in this field . 
I am convinced that impact assessments would help those who prepare political decisions . 
This is why I supported Mrs Niebler ' s report on the necessary changes to impact assessments , particularly regarding the introduction of an independent mechanism . 
Members of the Impact Assessment Committee (IAC) would be controlled by the European Parliament and the Council . 
As a result , they would no longer be under the President of the Commission ' s instructions . 
I voted in favour of this report . 
Impact assessments (IAs) are a key instrument in the legislative process . 
They show legislators the possible consequences of their policy options and help them make a decision , and legislators should make greater use of them in future . 
IAs can make a significant contribution to better law making . 
I agree that it is necessary to involve external experts from all policy areas as well as all stakeholder groups affected in the impact assessment process in order to guarantee independence and objectivity . 
Impact assessments (IAs) are an instrument central to the legislative process . 
Rigour requires the gathering of concrete facts for political decision making , and a guarantee that all the relevant strategic options will be examined when any specific problem is being solved . 
Impact studies should be applied to all legislative proposals , they should have a clear methodology , and they should be undertaken with full independence and transparency . 
IAs should also assess the option of inaction , as well as the specific consequences for small and medium-sized enterprises . 
Despite the improvements in this area , IAs by the European Commission and European Parliament could improve even further . 
This report , which I voted for , calls for closer involvement of Parliament ' s committees and a detailed explanation when the Commission refrains from issuing an IA . 
Finally , it challenges Parliament ' s committees to increase the use of IAs so as to improve the quality of its law making . 
I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on guaranteeing independent impact assessments . 
In the first place , the motion underlines the need , when carrying out impact assessments , to bear in mind the impact of new regulation on small and medium-sized enterprises and to reduce the regulatory burden on them . 
This emphasis on the needs of SMEs was key to my decision to vote in favour . 
In the second place , the motion highlights another very important factor , which is the specific nature of national economies . 
In order to safeguard their interests , the Commission should consult with individual Member States and the officials and representatives of the various national assessment bodies , in order to ensure that specific individual needs are not subordinate to Community interests . 
Finally , the motion calls for greater transparency and efficiency in the European Union ' s administration processes , urging the Commission to be accountable to Parliament for its work . 
In view of the points described above , I felt compelled to vote in favour . 
I voted in favour of this report because I agree that it is very important to continuously improve the quality of EU law making , and this report sets out concrete proposals for improving the law making process both within the European Parliament and the Commission . 
For some time , the Commission has already been carrying out impact assessments of legislation before submitting legislative proposals to the European Parliament and the Council , but the report states that these impact assessment procedures still need to be greatly improved . 
For example , we should strengthen the independence of the Impact Assessment Board , which is currently under the authority of the President of the Commission . 
The report also calls on the European Parliament itself and its committees to carry out impact assessments of draft legislation more often and to scrutinise more closely the impact assessments carried out by the Commission , which frequently serve to justify a legislative proposal rather than to permit an objective consideration of the facts . 
Such preliminary impact assessments of proposed EU legislation were further enhanced by the Treaty of Lisbon , which added provisions on the mandatory assessment of the social and environmental impact of any proposed legislation . 
Assertive and successful legislation requires not just good political debate and a joint effort leading to cooperation and consensus , but also a trustworthy technical basis that guides the legislative entities by assessing the context and consequences of the policies in question . 
For this very reason , I welcome the initiatives demonstrated by the European institutions to guarantee the quality and reliability of impact studies , which will involve guaranteeing their independence and transparency . 
in writing . - Having worked on this area at Committee level before , I am obliged to stress the point that impact assessments must be free from outside interference and that this independence must be protected at all levels . 
in writing . - I voted against the Niebler report on impact assessments . 
UKIP supports the concept of impact assessments but only if they are truly independent , have real teeth (such that the Commission has to take note of them) and are conducted at the national level to avoid producing a bland one-size-fits-all which will not enable national governments to assess the impact on their countries with sufficient accuracy . 
Unfortunately , the Niebler report fails to meet these criteria . 
One of the priority goals of European Union policy should be to introduce a transparent , clear , effective and high-quality regulatory environment . 
We have criticised the failings in transposition and implementation of the EU legislation in force numerous times , which result , to a large extent , from the fact that legislative texts have not been drafted properly . 
It is therefore the responsibility of Europe ' s legislative bodies to face up to this problem . 
Impact assessments (IAs) present a systematic assessment of the probable effects of legislation in health , fundamental rights , social , economic , environmental , etc . terms , thereby contributing to cutting red tape and ensuring the consistency of EU policy . 
I am voting for this initiative , which acknowledges that IAs have a key role in aiding the decision-making process . 
They must be characterised by total independence and transparency , must follow a clear methodology , and must proceed to a substantiated and objective analysis of the potential effects , which is always accompanied by a cost-benefit analysis . 
This will contribute to reaching well thought-out and fully informed decisions , which should lead to better-quality legislation , to more correct transposition , application and oversight , and to a faster legislative process . 
Impact assessments are tools that are especially useful for improving the quality of legislative activities (political proposals , for example) . 
However , these impact assessments need to be adapted: new adaptations are indeed necessary , in particular , through creating an independent mechanism , for the impact assessments proposed by the European Commission are often inconsistent from a qualitative point of view and generally only serve to justify a legislative proposal rather than allow for an objective examination of the facts . 
I am delighted that the report voted today stipulates that impact assessments be carried out totally independently; that impact assessments take a larger range of criteria into account (socio-economic , environmental , etc . ); and also that the highest transparency be guaranteed , especially where experts are involved . 
This is a matter that crops up in this Chamber time and time again , but it is nevertheless a highly important one ! 
Impact assessments (IAs) are a key instrument for the legislative process in that they take into account the potential consequences of applying given legislation , and so help reach a decision for that very reason . 
Independence and transparency are values that should be preserved and encouraged in any democracy in that they guarantee the public objective assessments , proportional decisions and legal procedure . 
I therefore agree , in general , with Parliament ' s proposals in this report . 
This report , drafted by Mrs Niebler , concerns the problem of ' guaranteeing independent impact assessments ' . 
Impact assessments (IAs) are crucial in order for the decisions we make to be the right ones . 
Without replacing the process of democratically deciding legislative authority , they nevertheless constitute the backbone of that same process . 
I am voting for this report because I share the rapporteur ' s view that IAs are crucial in order for us to carry out our work as law makers . 
The more we know about a given sector , the better our decision making with regard to it will be . 
Moreover , and despite the creation of the Impact Assessment Board (IAB) , created by the European Commission , and the positive results already achieved , I also believe it is crucial to create an autonomous IA structure for the European Parliament . 
Impact assessments (IAs) can constitute important support for the legislative process . 
To be so , they must study the economic , social , environmental and public health consequences of the intended political choices , along with their impact on the public ' s fundamental rights , throughout the political cycle . 
The assessment should not just be undertaken ex ante , but also ex post . 
However , the current IA process has numerous failings , as the report acknowledges . 
They often simply seek to convey supposed technical legitimacy and justification on measures that are the result of political choices and evaluations , which are conveniently hidden . 
There remain numerous questions regarding the methodology to be used in each case . 
On what or whom will the impact be measured ? 
What is the scope of the assessment ? 
What alternatives are to be analysed ? 
These decisions , too , normally depend on political choices and evaluations . 
That is why it is very important to ensure that impact studies are independent . 
In practice , however , this is difficult , given the multiple variables and interests involved . 
Transparency , openness , consultation , and public participation and scrutiny in connection with the studies and their results are of decisive importance in guaranteeing , as much as possible , this independence and the quality of the study . 
Impact assessments (IAs) can be of significant help from the standpoint of better law making if the economic , social , environmental and public health consequences of the intended political choices are studied throughout the political cycle , along with their impact on the public ' s fundamental rights . 
However , in the issues that emerge in impact studies , we have the criteria used in those IAs . 
We know that there are a number of criteria and not just cost-benefit , and even there we need to know who is being hit by costs and who is enjoying benefits . 
That is why it is very important to ensure that impact studies are independent but this is , in practice , a very difficult task , given the multiple variables and interests involved . 
The methodologies of some assessments and specialists will be more independent than others . 
In truth , however , IAs often serve more to justify the decisions they are intending to take rather than to really tackle all the implications of the legislation they are intending to adopt . 
Impact assessments are a central instrument of the legislative process , which European law makers must use to the full in future . 
Although they are in no way a substitute for political discussion or the democratic and legitimate decision-making process followed by law makers , and serve only to prepare the ground for political decisions , they draw the attention of law makers to the potential effects of their policies from the perspective of specialised content and help them to take decisions . 
In this way , they can make a considerable contribution to better law making . 
The Niebler report represents an important contribution to the debate on improving the EU legislative procedure , with a view to ensuring that new legislation serves citizens and is genuinely necessary . 
Unfortunately , there have been accusations that regulations are also being created which result merely from the desire to make the EU institutions better known , or from the actions of lobbyists . 
This means that we need to make constant improvements to procedures relating to what is known as the impact assessment for a particular legislative act . 
As rapporteur in previous years for the subject of better law making , I would like to highlight several aspects of this problem . 
Firstly , we should note the need to maintain the institutional balance enshrined in the Treaty , within which framework the European Commission proposes laws and Parliament and the Council adopt them . 
The independence of impact assessments is extremely important , but they must not be removed from Parliament ' s democratic control . 
In my opinion , the proposal to modify impact assessments after the introduction of amendments by Parliament is very important , and I also share the opinion of those who believe that we need to apply uniform criteria for impact assessments in all the institutions . 
At the same time , I would draw attention to the fact that the most crucial aspect of law making is the political will to resolve a given problem , and an impact assessment prepared as part of a particular project can merely supply objective information . 
I have already had the opportunity to say in this House that it is time indeed that impact assessments be not only systematic , but , above all , credible . 
That we should objectively assess the consequences of a piece of legislation before taking it any further , rather than seeking by all means to justify it . 
And that it is not up to the Commission services , judges , parties and torturers all together to preside over this assessment . 
I do not know whether the solutions put forward by the rapporteur are the right ones . 
On the other hand , I do know that I agree with her diagnosis and that some of her observations are particularly relevant . 
Member States must therefore be closely involved in these studies because they are in a better position to assess the national impact of initiatives coming from Brussels . 
These studies must guide the choices and reflection of national parliaments , who , from now on , are the guardians of the respect for the principle of subsidiarity . 
These studies should lead to the abstention of the Commission , if its action turns out to be pointless , redundant or costly . 
Finally , we should be able to quickly draw the consequences of a piece of legislation , the implementation of which creates more problems than it solves . 
For all these reasons , even though I am under no illusions about its realisation , I voted for Mrs Niebler ' s report . 
I welcomed this report because impact assessments (IAs) are a key instrument in the legislative process , and one which European legislators should make greater use of in future . 
The benefits of IAs are obvious . 
IAs show legislators the possible consequences of their policy options and help them to make a decision . 
IAs can thus make a significant contribution to better law making . 
However , IAs can in no way be a substitute for political debate and the legislator ' s democratic and legitimate decision-making process . 
IAs merely contribute to the preparation of the specific content of a political decision . 
This report falls into four sections . 
First of all , the report sets out the general requirements for IAs at European level . 
The second section discusses the Commission ' s IAs and highlights scope for improvement . 
The third section is devoted to the IAs carried out by the European Parliament . 
The fourth and final section calls for an autonomous IA structure within the European Parliament which all of Parliament ' s committees should use to further improve law making and create synergies . 
in writing . - I have several reasons why I support this resolution . 
First of all , it underlines that impact assessment can never be a substitute for political debate and the legislator ' s decision-making process , but should only help the technical preparation of political decisions . 
This would certainly improve the decision-making process . 
Secondly , the impact assessments have to take a large number of criteria into account in order to provide the legislator with a comprehensive picture . 
Only in this way can the legislator do his job efficiently . 
The process of assessing the impacts of a regulation contributes significantly towards reducing the bureaucratic burden that is a by-product of statutory regulation . 
A special Impact Assessment Board was set up at Commission level some time ago , and it assesses impacts both ex ante and ex post . 
The Commission also carries out public consultations on its legislative plans . 
The European Parliament has so far lacked an impact assessment body . 
I therefore applaud the fact that the report calls for the creation of infrastructure making it possible to evaluate the impacts of proposals and plans formulated in Parliament . 
I would also like to call on the Commission to concentrate more , when performing impact assessments , on the transparency of the entire assessment process , to strive harder for its independence , and not to aim for just one solution to a problem in its proposals , but to assess multiple variant solutions to a specific situation independently . 
I would also like to call for a simplification of the process of public consultations , and an extension of the deadlines for submitting concrete proposals , including the possibility of submitting proposals in all official languages of the Union . 
I supported Mrs Niebler ' s report on guaranteeing independent impact assessments . 
Impact assessments are a key instrument in better law making policy , which aims to improve and simplify new and existing legislation . 
Impact assessments are , in fact , a suitable instrument for evaluating the impact of the adoption of new laws and the simplification and recasting of existing laws . 
However , I believe that recognition of their usefulness should always depend on respect for certain fundamental principles , such as transparency and independence . 
I therefore agree with the rapporteur when she underlines the fact that the Commission has recently raised the quality of its impact assessments , while pointing out that further improvements are still needed . 
Finally , I applaud the decision to create an autonomous impact assessment structure for the European Parliament , with a view to further enhancing the quality of European Union law making . 
in writing . - I voted for this report . 
Impact Assessments (IAs) are a key instrument for the legislative process , of which European legislators should make greater use in future . 
The benefits of IAs are obvious . 
They show legislators the possible consequences of their policy options and help them reach a decision . 
IAs can thus make a significant contribution to better law making . 
However , they can in no way be a substitute for political debate and the legislator ' s democratically legitimate decision-making process . 
They merely permit the technical and substantive preparation of a political decision . 
The impact assessment instrument presented by the rapporteur is a good way of improving the quality of law making at European level . 
Mutual assessment , however , should take into account not just financial impacts , but should also focus on other aspects , such as the economic , environmental and social aspects . 
As a doctor , I would like to emphasise , above all , the impact on human health . 
We must also not forget the very important role played by Member States in impact assessment , as they must incorporate the proposed legislation into their legal systems . 
Impact assessments are a key instrument for the legislative process , and one of which European legislators should make greater use in future , as they show the possible consequences of their policy options . 
We should not forget , however , that they merely permit the technical , substantive preparation of a political decision . 
We believe that the impact assessments used by the European institutions should comply with certain principles . 
First of all they should be completely independent and transparent . 
They should cover all categories of legislative proposal , employ a clear methodology , and must always be kept up to date with current developments in the legislative process . 
We also believe the Commission should provide Parliament with a detailed explanation in cases where it considers it unnecessary to assess the impact of its decisions . 
Finally , we confirm the importance of the creation of an autonomous structure for carrying out impact assessments within Parliament , with a view to further enhancing the quality of its law making and creating new synergies . 
I welcome this text which condemns the European Commission ' s partiality . 
It is a shame that it does not condemn the fact that the European Commission alone has the power to initiate legislation . 
Impact assessments (IAs) are very important to the legislative process and should be encouraged in the future . 
IAs have great benefits: they alert legislators to the consequences of their options , and contribute to better and more conscious decision making . 
They therefore make a significant contribution to excellence in law making . 
in writing . - I scrutinised the report very attentively and summarised its key points: (1) the scope of scrutiny (not only cost-benefit analysis , but an integrated approach); (2) the inclusion of stakeholders from all the policy areas while the methodology and final quality control should remain under the remit of the European institutions , with an increased consultation period from 8 to 12 weeks; (3) the revision of the interinstitutional common approach to impact assessment to encourage all the institutions to implement a common methodology on IAs . 
Potential for improvement at the Commission level: (1) the increased scrutiny by the European Parliament and the Council over the Impact Assessment Board; (2) systematic ex-post assessments of existing legislation and analysis of the relevant ECJ case-law . 
Potential for improvement at EP level: the main focus is the creation of an autonomous structure within the EP led by a supervisory board consisting of MEPs , possibly appointed at the beginning of each term , making use of the existing resources but also of seconded national experts . 
I abstained from voting because I do not understand on which criteria experts for the Advisory Board will be appointed and what power they will have . 
I cannot support the report . 
I voted for this report because I believe impact assessments (IAs) are a key instrument for the legislative process , and one which European legislators should make greater use of in future . 
The benefits of IAs are obvious . 
They show legislators the possible consequences of their options and help them in making a decision . 
IAs can thus make a significant contribution to better law making . 
However , they can in no way be a substitute for political debate and the legislator ' s democratic decision-making process , merely enabling the technical preparation of a political decision . 
The European Commission has raised the quality of its IAs , particularly through the foundation of its Impact Assessment Board (IAB) . 
However , in light of the report of the European Court of Auditors , I believe the Commission ' s IAs could be improved . 
I agree that closer involvement of the European Parliament ' s committees in this work could be useful in improving the quality of IAs . 
Impact assessments make a significant technical contribution to better law making as they show legislators the possible consequences of their policy options . 
They are a key instrument for the European legislative process . 
The draft report divides these evaluations into four sections . 
The first section takes the view that the impact assessments used by the European institutions should comply with certain principles and should be completely independent and transparent . 
The second section discusses the Commission ' s impact assessments and highlights scope for improvement . 
The third section is devoted to the impact assessments carried out by the European Parliament , which its committees are invited to use more extensively in order to further improve law making . 
The fourth and final section calls for an autonomous impact assessment structure within the European Parliament which all of Parliament ' s committees should use to create more synergies . 
With regard to the above , and in view of the fact that impact assessments can in no way be a substitute for political debate and the legislator ' s democratically legitimated decision-making process , but merely permit the technical , substantive preparation of a political decision , I voted in favour of the motion . 
in writing . - Impact assessments (IAs) are a key instrument for the legislative process , and one of which European legislators should make greater use in future . 
The benefits of IAs are obvious .

IAs can thus make a significant contribution to better law making . 
However , they can in no way be a substitute for political debate and the legislator ' s democratically legitimated decision-making process . 
They merely permit the technical , substantive preparation of a political decision . 
The IAs used by the European institutions should comply with certain principles . 
First of all , they should be completely independent and transparent , cover all categories of legislative proposal and employ a clear methodology . 
The policy options listed should also include the option of taking no action . 
The specific consequences for small and medium-sized enterprises should be taken into account where appropriate and they must always be kept up to date with current developments in the legislative process . 
Parliament ' s key demand is the creation of an autonomous structure for carrying out impact assessments within Parliament , with a view to further enhancing the quality of its law making and creating synergies with the possibility of a common mechanism for all EU institutions . 
in writing . - I welcome this report as I believe impact assessments to be a key instrument in the legislative process . 
European legislators should make greater use of these instruments as they can improve the legislative process by showing the possible impacts of their policy decisions . 
Legislators must not be afraid to state harsh realities when looking at potential impacts . 
Not only should impact assessments state the possibilities and make recommendations to legislators , they must also be prepared to recommend taking no action at all if it is considered to be the most appropriate course . 
Legislation coming from Europe has a massive impact on the lives of those living within its borders and we must use every opportunity to ensure this legislation is as fair and balanced as possible . 
European legislation is too often complex , difficult to understand and difficult to apply . 
This is why impact assessments can make a significant contribution to improving the quality of EU law making , particularly in terms of reducing the timescales and costs of the legislative process . 
I support this measure because , by taking the requirements of Member States into greater consideration , it will be possible to evaluate the possible social , environmental , financial and economic consequences of a legal act . 
Impact assessments should also be completely independent and transparent and be carried out in the early stages of the legislative process . 
The independence of impact assessments (IAs) needs to be guaranteed , above all , because of their importance in the decision-making process . 
As such , while they do not replace the decision of whether or not to adopt a given solution , they can be decisive in shaping the choice of a given political solution . 
It is , therefore , crucial to adopt any measures that might strengthen the guarantees that IAs will be transparent and independent , since that will help maximise this instrument ' s role as an aid to the decision-making process , and as a guarantee of the quality and suitability of the EU institutions ' activities . 
in writing . - We abstained . 
Moreover , we presented an alternative resolution in which we wanted to clarify the role of impact assessment and external experts in the impact assessment process . 
Impact assessment can only be an aid for making political decisions and should never replace political decisions within the democratic decision-making process . 
Impact assessments are a key instrument for the legislative process . 
The benefits are obvious: they make a significant contribution to better law making . 
However , they can in no way be a substitute for the legislator ' s democratically legitimated decision-making process . 
The report adopted today underlines Parliament ' s belief that the impact assessments used by the European institutions should be completely independent and transparent . 
They should cover all categories of legislative proposal and employ a clear methodology . 
Parliament also calls for the creation of an autonomous structure for carrying out impact assessments within Parliament , with a view to further enhancing the quality of its law making and creating synergies . 
in writing . - I welcome S&D amendments to this report at committee stage representing greater transparency in the legislative process and promoting greater ease of access for SMEs and NGOs through the publication of road maps and an extended consultation period . 
Impact assessments are so important to our work in Parliament and should play a greater role , which is why I supported this report . 
The impact assessments (IAs) carried out in the European Union benefit all Europeans because they contribute to better law making through independent analysis of potential and possible European-level measures . 
The rapporteur demonstrates the need to analyse better and more efficiently the economic , social , environmental and public health consequences of the Union ' s political choices . 
IAs play a key role in a policy ' s entire development cycle , and are also necessary for high-quality legislation , and for its proper transposition and application . 
I therefore support Parliament ' s proposed criteria for consideration when IAs are undertaken . 
With regard to this , I should like to stress that these IAs need to be undertaken as early as possible in order to minimise potential negative effects , and to take into account the greatest possible number of institutional , economic and civil stakeholders . 
However , they must not just be promoted prior to a piece of legislation (ex ante) , but also following its adoption (ex post) . 
IAs must be independent and undertaken in a transparent and objective way . 
They should accompany legislative proposals and follow a common system and common methodology within the European Parliament . 
Impact assessments are a valuable legislative instrument , serving as a knowledge-based preparation for political decisions , and thus contributing to better law making . 
Transparency , a uniform quality standard and the presentation of the advantages and disadvantages of a sufficient number of political options are the key to reliable impact assessments . 
For this reason , I voted in favour of the alternative proposal tabled by the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance . 
I am voting for this report , but I believe that a potential optional system could be beneficial for consumers and small and medium-sized enterprises if the Commission puts forward concrete data that indicate a need for further progress in order for the consultation carried out by the Commission to remain transparent . 
in writing . - I voted in favour of this resolution on the Green Paper from the Commission on policy options for progress towards a European contract law for consumers and business . 
Contract law determines and organises transactions within the Internal Market; its potential for both hindering and facilitating those transactions is therefore obvious . 
Choosing the right way forward in the area of contract law can make a significant contribution to improving the functioning of the Internal Market and opening up its full potential for businesses , in particular SMEs , and consumers . 
The potential benefits of European contract law to the Internal Market have been discussed for a good many years . 
The EP pronounced itself for the first time on the issue in 1989 and , with this resolution which the EP adopted today , it intends to respond to the recent Commission Green Paper on European contract law , and to set out the Parliament ' s priorities in this area . 
I support the view of the rapporteur that the option of setting up an optional instrument (OI) for European contract law by virtue of a regulation is to be favoured . 
It could be complemented by a ' toolbox ' for Commission and legislator which should be implemented by an interinstitutional agreement . 
The most obvious obstacles which consumers and small and medium-sized enterprises face with regard to the Single Market are complex contractual relations , unfair terms and conditions in contracts , inadequate and insufficient information , time-consuming procedures , language barriers , different taxation systems , reliability of online traders , demographic composition of the population of individual Member States , concerns regarding confidentiality , complaint handling and intellectual property rights . 
European contract law stipulates and regulates Internal Market transactions , and aims to resolve problems relating to the Single Market which have arisen for various reasons , including even differences in contract law legislation . 
This makes it vital to provide a coherent European contract law regime in order to achieve the Internal Market ' s full potential and help meet our Europe 2020 strategy objectives . 
Choosing the right way forward in the area of contract law can make a significant contribution to improving the functioning of the Internal Market and opening up its full potential for businesses , in particular , small and medium-sized enterprises , and consumers . 
This is why I voted in favour of this report . 
The potential advantages of a European contract law for the Single Market have been debated a great deal over these last few years . 
In this regard , I think that we need to support the introduction of an optional instrument by way of regulation so that this parallel system does not work against national systems . 
This is the approach chosen by Mrs Wallis ' report and I therefore supported it . 
I voted in favour of this report . 
In the wake of the global financial crisis , it is very important to realise the full potential of the Internal Market , and thus help meet the strategic goals of the Europe 2020 strategy . 
Today , owing to many factors , including a failure to implement existing single market legislation , the Single Market remains fragmented . 
Consumers have no confidence in cross-border commerce and companies face huge administrative and legal difficulties if they want to expand their activities in other EU Member States . 
Divergence of contract law at national level leads to additional transaction costs , legal uncertainty for companies and a lack of consumer confidence in the Internal Market . 
It is partly for these reasons that consumers and enterprises , particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with limited resources , avoid cross-border transactions , which prevents the creation of a competitive Internal Market . 
I agree with the report ' s call to take action and propose methods of harmonising contract law practice at EU level , which would ensure equal and fair conditions for market participants . 
Contracts are the fundamental links in relationships between companies and consumers . 
The European Union ' s Single Market is founded on a variety of contracts regulated by various national-level bodies of law . 
These differences in contract law discourage companies , and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in particular , from dedicating themselves to cross-border trade , thus preventing them from accessing the new opportunities and income offered by the Internal Market . 
Furthermore , consumers are disadvantaged by limited choice , high prices and lower quality because of weak cross-border competition . 
It should be noted , for example , that only 8% of consumers buy online from other Member States . 
This report , which I voted for , advocates the need for an Optional Instrument (OI) for European-level contract law in the form of a regulation . 
This will enable consumers to enjoy better protection under the umbrella of European contract law , and better security when they make cross-border transfers . 
For their part , companies - SMEs in particular - will find it easier and less costly to conclude contracts under the umbrella of a common body of EU contract law . 
I voted against Mrs Wallis ' s report because the optional instrument envisaged , based on a regulation , basically marks the first step towards harmonising contract law in Member States . 
I think that such harmonisation , even to a minimal extent , is inconceivable at the present stage in view of the different way contractual relations are regulated in Member States . 
For example , there is the right in rem effect , which does not feature in German law . 
Apart from this , harmonisation of contract law would not prevent the discrepancies in other areas influencing transnational trade within the EU . 
There is no categorical proof indicating that it is these legal differences which are preventing transactions from being completed with foreign companies and consumers . 
Contracts with an international element are currently drawn up based on international private law and , at EU level , on the basis of Regulation (EC) No 593 / 2008 . 
An additional instrument would introduce unnecessary confusion . 
With regard to contractual relations without any international element , I think that every Member State must continue to apply its own national legislation , according to its legal tradition and established practices . 
I voted against a report that proposes an optional legal instrument for contract law , effectively laying the foundations for a future body of European civil law , to take precedence over domestic civil laws . 
This would mean the end of national legal traditions and the laws that every Member State has laid down on issues as sensitive as civil and contract law . 
In any case , although the objective of introducing an optional instrument is to facilitate cross-border trade , taking the needs of consumers and companies into due account , it must be borne in mind that existing European legislation already satisfies the needs of the various actors involved . 
The real objective of the report therefore appears to be more ambitious than the creation of a European civil code , with which I cannot agree . 
I offer my congratulations on the work carried out by the rapporteur , for which I voted . 
This report responds to the needs of consumers and small and medium-sized enterprises , which , unlike other actors representing bigger economic entities , have obvious difficulties accessing the Internal Market because of the enormous costs they have to bear . 
As a direct result , both SMEs and consumers tend to carry out transactions within the domestic market , which is often much less competitive , and therefore do not access the cross-border market , in which products are often at least 10% cheaper than the domestic offer . 
The divergence in contract law rights must be remedied , and the creation of an optional instrument for European contract law by means of a regulation , which would flank rather than replace Member States ' national contract law systems , is an optimal solution that would give the parties the freedom to choose the legal instrument most suited to their needs . 
in writing . - I voted against the introduction of EU contract law as I do not believe Brussels should be making legislation where national legislation already exists . 
By introducing EU contract law and making it optional for businesses to choose domestic or European legislation , it confuses the system and will create legislative overlaps that may result in expensive tribunals . 
It is also likely that EU contract law will favour EU social and employment policy , such as the Working Time Directive , which has both proven highly unpopular and caused disruption in the UK for a range of essential industries and services . 
It is also highly likely that legislation that , for the time being , carries a discretional opt-in will later be made obligatory by the EU . 
The Wallis report sets ambitious objectives in respect of conceivable measures with a view to establishing a European contract law for consumers and businesses . 
The issues at stake are crucial since this is about improving how the Internal Market works by including businesses and consumers more . 
On the one hand , we need to get rid of the differences in terms of contract law so as to remove the obstacles facing businesses . 
On the other hand , we need to ensure a high level of protection for European consumers . 
Given the significant impact of contract law on financial transactions and , therefore , on the Internal Market , I welcome all the efforts made by the Commission and the European Parliament towards harmonising their parameters within the EU and adapting them to the Single Market . 
I am voting for the report tabled on this issue . 
in writing . - Many recent events have shown us the importance of consumer confidence and this is , in part , borne from proper laws to protect consumers in the marketplace . 
As such , it is imperative that this issue is addressed on a European level . 
The Wallis report is an important step in implementing the Single Market Act , and I am delighted about its adoption . 
At a time when differences in national laws restrict cross-border trade substantially , especially for SMEs , introducing a framework for European contract law is a real step forward that we should support . 
By regulating both business-to-business and business-to-consumer contractual relations , adopting an optional instrument together with a ' toolbox ' could ensure enhanced protection of consumers in Europe . 
The existence of European-level contract law , which has been debated at length within the institutions , could represent a range of benefits for businesses , for consumers and for the smooth running of the Internal Market . 
We are therefore not indifferent to the potential linked to the existence of a common body of general standards and principles applicable to contract law , in terms of increasing cross-border transactions , of regulating e-commerce and of improving consumers ' access to products . 
However , and as argued by the rapporteur , I believe that an optional instrument for European contract law that exists alongside national legislation , but does not replace , is a suitable choice . 
This report , by Mrs Wallis , concerns policy options for progress towards a European contract law for consumers and businesses . 
A correct option in terms of European contract law could benefit the Internal Market , small and medium-sized enterprises and consumers . 
This issue has been current in the European Parliament since 1989 , which led the Commission to draw up an action plan in 2003 . 
The commission tabled a proposal for a directive on consumer rights in 2008 , has drafted two progress reports and has now tabled a series of measures in the form of a Green Paper , to which this report seeks to respond . 
Given that the proposals tabled - following ten years of studies - will contribute to solving the detected failings , which are essentially to do with contracts , and that there is a need to promote the Internal Market by removing barriers , I am voting for this report , which introduces an optional instrument (OI) that could be complemented with ' a toolbox ' aimed at resolving the problem of contracts . 
The report seeks to dress itself up in rhetoric surrounding the defence of consumers and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) . 
Its context , however , includes dangers for both: consumers & SMEs . 
The rapporteur ' s vision is markedly neoliberal , as is clear from the stress given to breaking down ' barriers faced by those who wish to enter into cross-border transactions in the Internal Market and considers that , along with other measures , the European contract law project could be useful for realising the full potential of the Internal Market ' . 
The liberalisations and deepening of the Internal Market that the EU has been carrying out demonstrate that it is big business that benefits above all . 
The present dynamics suggest that proposals for the harmonisation of contracts - still optional at this stage - will be implemented with these same interests at the forefront . 
These reservations are borne out by statements in the report , such as that the optional instrument ' must offer a very high level of consumer protection , in order to compensate consumers for the protection that they would normally enjoy under their national law ' . 
It also stresses that the instrument proposed at EU-level , which is the same for all contracts in the European Union , is also set out in very general terms . 
This is a clearly neoliberal report that is concerned with the interests of businesses - larger businesses in particular - because in a totally liberalised Internal Market , it is those with power who gain the most , despite the propaganda about defending small and medium-sized enterprises and consumers . 
However , all this is an attempt to dress up the product in order to hide its real dangers from the electorate . 
Therefore , we are not voting in favour of the report . 
It also advocates an EU-level instrument , albeit optional , that is the same for all contracts in the European Union , which is also set out in very general terms . 
Here are some statements made in the report:
 ' Supports action to address the range of barriers faced by those who wish to enter into cross-border transactions in the Internal Market and considers that , along with other measures , the European contract law project could be useful for realising the full potential of the Internal Market ' ;
 ' Believes that both business-to-business and business-to-consumer contracts should be covered; emphasises that the [optional instrument] must offer a very high level of consumer protection , in order to compensate consumers for the protection that they would normally enjoy under their national law; wishes for further explanation on how this could be achieved ' . 
Contract law determines and organises transactions in the Single Market . 
By selecting the right way forwards in the area of contract law , it is possible to contribute in a significant way to the better functioning of the Single Market and to making its full potential available to businesses (especially small and medium-sized ones) and consumers . 
Bearing in mind the fact that every initiative in the area of contract law will have to respond clearly to the actual needs and problems of businesses and consumers , I take the view that any justification in this area will have to be based on practical evidence relating to the current situation in contract law and any difficulties encountered by businesses and consumers , particularly in cross-border transactions . 
The broad and balanced involvement of the participants is of fundamental importance . 
It will be particularly decisive during the legislative process , and all available resources will be required in order to ensure inclusivity and transparency . 
We need diverse impact assessment , drawing on a broad range of policy options and focusing on the practical issues that are important for the operation of an optional instrument . 
What Mrs Wallis is proposing is nothing short of creating a 28th legal system , in addition to national laws , which it intends to replace in practice; the words legislative ' harmonisation ' and ' standardisation ' are now feared in the European political context . 
This new European law is supposed to remove barriers to cross-border trade , arising from the differences between national legal systems . 
The problem is that nothing in Mrs Wallis ' report proves the objective existence of such barriers , and therefore of a problem that needs to be solved . 
Consequently , nothing , except the will to initiate a new method of imposing supranational legislation , justifies such a position . 
In addition , it would run the real risk of being used to bypass protective national provisions , especially in relation to consumer rights . 
That is why I voted against this report . 
I abstained from voting on this report because , according to the rapporteur , complexity in contractual relations is one of the most evident impediments that consumers and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) face in the Single Market . 
Hence , the proposal to establish a common European contract law , which would benefit consumers and help ensure increased cross-border trade within the Internal Market . 
According to the rapporteur , all parties , be it in business-to-business (B2B) or business-to-consumer (B2C) transactions , should be free to choose or not to choose the optional instrument (OI) as an alternative to national or international law (opt-in) . 
Further attention is required to ensure that the OI offers protection to consumers and small businesses given their position as the weaker commercial partner and that any confusion is avoided when making a choice of law . 
I abstained from voting because the EU recently adopted the Rome I Regulation , which regulates this area and defends consumer rights well , whereas this proposal is purely based on the UK situation and would only cause turbulence and increased bureaucracy . 
I do not support the proposal to create an entirely new legal instrument in the form of a European contract law . 
The creation of this instrument is the first step towards the creation of a pan-European civil code , which would gradually replace the contract law of the individual Member States . 
The proposed concept may talk about the voluntary application of this instrument , but nevertheless it is clear from many indications that volunteering is only a kind of precursor to a subsequent mandatory application in cross-border contractual relationships . 
If this instrument is created , we will be introducing a completely new type of supranational law , which will be on the boundary between EU law and international private and commercial law , not to mention the fact that the mandate for creating a European contract law for consumers and businesses does not have sufficient support in primary EU law . 
We should therefore stick to a standard instrument , for which there is sufficient legal support in primary law in the form of harmonisation . 
When it comes to implementing the common market , we should not make do with removing the positive barriers between the Member States of the Union . 
To enjoy the fruits of an effective integrated market , it is also necessary to tackle the indirect causes that stifle the cross-border aspirations of our fellow citizens . 
On top of a number of administrative difficulties , European entrepreneurs are too often faced with very diverse contractual regulations in force in the Member States . 
These obstacles are particularly difficult to overcome for SMEs , which nevertheless are the most effective tool for boosting growth . 
As a result , the European Commission has published a Green Paper on the subject and launched a broad public consultation . 
I voted for Parliament ' s present resolution for it takes a common sense approach by proposing an instrument that is concurrent with national legislation and would facilitate cross-border trade . 
This ' European contract ' would be optional , would come with a ' toolbox ' to clarify how it should be used and it would encourage greater protection of consumers . 
in writing . - I voted against this report . 
Divergences in European contract law end up discouraging businesses from engaging in cross-border trade and keep them from benefiting from opportunities and gains which the Internal Market offers . 
Consequently , consumers are also disadvantaged by limited product choice , higher prices and lower quality due to weak cross-border competition . 
In this regard , we wish to introduce some innovations , including business-to-business and business-to-consumer contracts regulated by an optional instrument that would enlarge the parties ' choice , and the introduction of a monitoring and review mechanism in order to ensure that the optional instrument keeps up with market needs and legal and economic developments . 
Simplicity and readiness for use should be a key objective . 
Provisions on sale of goods merit priority , as do service contracts . 
Finally , the introduction of a trust mark system would ensure additional consumer protection . 
Choosing the right way forward in the area of contract law can make a significant contribution to improving the functioning of the Internal Market and opening up its full potential for businesses , in particular , small and medium-sized enterprises , and consumers . 
Although I believe that there is still a lot to be done in terms of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and of consumer rights , this report is a first step in facilitating cross-border trade between SMEs . 
in writing . - Labour Euro MPs want to see improvements in the Single Market and to facilitate cross-border transactions for consumers and small businesses . 
However , consumer and business groups have come together on this issue to reject Mrs Wallis ' proposal of an optional instrument of contract law . 
They maintain that rules of national contract law are not a factor in influencing consumer attitudes to buying from another Member State; in fact , there are other genuine barriers to cross-border trade , such as administrative and cultural differences and a lack of effective means of redress for consumers . 
Mrs Wallis has failed to provide compelling evidence of the need for an optional instrument . 
Indeed , such a proposal could even undermine existing consumer rights . 
We need to take time and evaluate the seven options in the Green Paper and make an evidence-based decision on the basis of clear impact assessments . 
Similarly , we cannot accept the ECR toolbox-based approach without sufficient evidence and impact assessment to demonstrate that this is the best way to protect consumers and help businesses . 
We owe it to our consumers and businesses to make the right decision for them and ensure that any change of law affecting their rights is properly thought through . 
Contract law determines and organises transactions within the Internal Market , so its potential for both hindering and facilitating those transactions is therefore obvious . 
Choosing the right way forward in the area of contract law could make a significant contribution to improving the functioning of the Internal Market , and to opening up its full potential for businesses , in particular , small and medium-sized enterprises , and consumers . 
It merits attention that the Parliament has , in its various resolutions on this matter , repeatedly acknowledged the benefits an improved contract law framework has on the Internal Market , has further welcomed the idea of a common frame of reference , and has insisted on close involvement of itself and the stakeholders concerned . 
in writing . - On 1 July 2010 , the Commission presented a Green Paper on policy options for progress towards a European contract law for consumers and businesses . 
The policy options include soft law options , an opt-in regime called the 28th system , the unlikely approximation of substantive national law (because of resistance by the Council and the impossibility of overnight merging of national legal traditions) and the option of creating a fully fledged European civil code . 
I totally support the report , especially in the context of human rights violations in the Latvian Republic . 
I voted in favour . 
European contract law should ensure a more smoothly-running Internal Market and this report draws particular attention to the potential benefits for SMEs and consumers . The related efforts to find a common legal framework here have been ongoing since 1989 . 
In 2008 , the EU Commission circulated a proposal for a directive on consumer rights . 
It is of far greater importance for Europe ' s consumers that consumer protection should be improved at EU level . 
This should not take the form of restrictive actions , such as those once familiar when bank accounts were overdrawn , but instead should combat shady business practices , fraud , etc . 
It is open to question whether European contract law will improve market access for small enterprises because , according to analyses , it is mainly medium to large-sized retail businesses that are involved in cross-border trade , something that is due to the bureaucratic red tape entailed , as well as the costs . 
The existing problems with cross-border online shopping will persist for some time to come . 
Furthermore , it has not been established beyond all doubt that standardisation is really necessary . 
When in doubt , I back the principle of subsidiarity , which is why I am voting against the Wallis report . 
A Europe that belongs to its citizens can only work as a Europe of homelands , subsidiarity and national sovereignty . 
Until now , it has seemed as if European contract law was something unnecessary and the general principle applies that if a provision is not necessary , then it should be omitted . 
I also believe that this report is a diversionary tactic , designed to draw attention away from the fact that something far more important , namely , EU-wide consumer protection , is still in need of improvement . 
It is for that reason that I am voting against this report . 
A unified contract law regime must be applied in the European Union . 
Above all , this would remove obstacles often faced by consumers and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the Single Market relating to the complexity of contractual relations . 
Furthermore , a common European contract law would ensure increased cross-border trade in the Internal Market . 
The Rome I Regulation currently in force is an adequate regulatory instrument , which provides for a high level of protection of the weaker contractual party . 
The provisions of this regulation protect consumers when seeking redress from businesses in other Member States with whom they have entered into a contract . 
Given that a well-functioning legal regulation mechanism is already in force in this area in the European Union , I do not endorse this resolution on policy options for progress towards a European contract law for consumers and businesses , which proposes adopting a new regulation , which would set up a new optional instrument , to be applied in business-to-business and business-to-consumer transactions . 
Attention should be drawn to the fact that the new regulation would result in much confusion and a lack of clarity in this area . 
Furthermore , its implementation would require additional funding and increased bureaucracy . 
Divergences in contract law in the Member States create structural problems that discourage businesses and consumers . 
Mrs Wallis ' s motion for a resolution favours the creation of an optional instrument for European contract law for consumers and businesses by virtue of a general regulation , and this is why I voted in favour of the text . 
Furthermore , the instrument would not replace Member States ' contract laws , but would merely help ensure a better choice of contract model between the parties , thanks to examples based on general principles , definitions and model regulations for both commercial and consumer contracts , without going against the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality . 
I voted in favour of the report on the creation of a European law of contract for consumers and businesses which will help to facilitate cross-border transactions and strengthen the Internal Market , especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and consumers . 
The differences in contract law between the various Member States are slowing down SMEs wishing to carry out cross-border transactions . 
We need to adopt a flexible procedure that will provide security to small and medium-sized enterprises and consumers and help to protect the parties ' rights . 
That is why creating an optional instrument that will operate as a standard for SMEs alongside national rules , by broadening the parties ' options , is the right strategy . 
I voted for this report on policy options for progress towards a European contract law for consumers and businesses . 
In fact , contract law determines and organises transactions within the Internal Market , so its potential for both hindering and facilitating those transactions is therefore obvious . 
Choosing the right way forward in the area of contract law could make a significant contribution to improving the functioning of the Internal Market , and to opening up its full potential for businesses , in particular , small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) , and consumers . 
I would stress the need for broad and balanced stakeholder involvement . 
The present Commission working method involving an expert and a stakeholder group already ensures the participation of stakeholders . 
However , as the process has not yet left the consultation phase , it is important to ensure that the legislative procedure itself does not start yet . 
Stakeholder involvement will be particularly essential during that legislative procedure , the inclusivity and transparency of which will have to be ensured by all available means . 
in writing . - The EU cannot claim to be a single market if obstacles to trade still exist . 
The immense costs incurred in cross-border trading represent a serious barrier . 
Between legal fees , translation fees and implementation fees , it can cost small businesses up to EUR 15 000 to enter the e-commerce market of just one Member State . 
According to a Flash Eurobarometer survey in 2008 , this barrier is seen as a major concern by up to 60% of retailers . 
If laws regulating consumer transactions were harmonised throughout the EU , small and medium businesses (SMEs) and consumers in all Member States would benefit . 
The removal of these barriers would encourage more SMEs to exploit the potential of e-commerce . 
I believe SMEs are crucial for economic recovery in many Member States . 
Ireland ' s path to recovery is being export-led; thus the removal of barriers entering in the EU market is crucial . 
The findings and recommendations of this report also show the potential for great benefits for consumers . 
If cross-border trade increases , consumers will be offered a wider choice of products and more competitive prices . 
One of the most burning issues in EU law involves the harmonisation of contract law . 
On the one hand , it seems that the need for greater internal consistency is being felt , in order that companies can benefit from the common market ' s potential without fearing that there might be solutions in a given foreign legal system that they had not anticipated and for which they had not prepared , which has been a real problem . 
On the other , however , there is a certain resistance amongst Member States to sacrificing their legal solutions , which is hardly surprising given that these have developed over centuries and that they are widely known by their respective populations . 
As such , in its Green Paper of 1 July 2010 , the Commission tabled several solutions for regulatory models ranging from mere soft law to a European civil code . 
Of the various hypotheses , the European Parliament is in favour of the creation of an optional instrument in the form of a regulation , that governs cross-border transactions first of all , and that can potentially also be used for internal contracts , albeit optionally . 
This seems like a reasonable solution to me , so I voted in favour . 
in writing . - In favour . 
The report intends to respond to the recent Commission Green Paper on European contract law and to set out the Parliament ' s priorities in this area . 
The potential benefits of European contract law for the Internal Market have been discussed in the interinstitutional framework and with the broad public for a many years , and Parliament pronounced for the first time on the issue in 1989 . 
The Commission broadened the debate by issuing its communication of 2001 , focusing on possible problems which divergences in contract law might raise within the Internal Market and on possible options for action . 
Within the light of the responses to this consultation , the Commission issued an action plan in 2003 , proposing , inter alia , the elaboration of a common frame of reference and containing definitions , common principles and model rules , with a view to improving the quality and coherence of European contract law . 
In a further communication , in 2004 , the Commission set out the follow-up to that action plan and also proposed to review the Union acquis in this area . 
In 2008 , it submitted a proposal for a directive on consumer rights . 
I consider that we need to improve the operation of the Internal Market and explore every avenue that will benefit businesses , especially SMEs , and consumers . 
Within this framework , Mrs Wallis ' s report is a move in the right direction: it refers to the adverse impact which differences in contract law within the Internal Market are having both on consumers and on businesses , and to the benefits to the Internal Market of an improved contract law framework . 
I consider that , in order to achieve this , we need to create a user-friendly , flexible , clear legislative act which , where feasible , is binding on the Member States and which will facilitate and provide security of law to contracting parties , without interfering in national laws and without affecting the financially weaker . 
in writing . - I am disappointed that this report has passed through Parliament . 
I was unable to support it because , as a response to a Commission Green Paper , it ruled out far too many options for the future of an EU contract law and neglected a duty to request an impact assessment on the full costs and implications of each of the Commission ' s options . 
As yet , there is no European contract law , even though the option of such a law has been debated within European institutions for over 20 years . 
The Commission now intends to propose , by way of regulation , the introduction of an optional instrument , commonly referred to as the ' 28th law ' , which could govern cross-border contracts . 
Whilst the intention to simplify contract law and expand cross-border trade is commendable , I nonetheless have doubts about the relevance of this approach: indeed there is a high risk that national rules , which provide maximum protection for consumers , will be bypassed . 
For this reason , I have decided to abstain on this own-initiative report , pending the Commission ' s proposal for a regulation on this matter . 
One consequence of the implementation of the Internal Market is an increase in the number of potential consumers in the European Union . 
To date , however , there has been no European-level harmonisation of the rules on contracts for consumers and businesses . 
This results in the constant presence of obstacles to the Internal Market ' s full implementation because of differences in the law at national level , and because of the fragmentation of consumer law itself . 
The report ' s proposal is to analyse the viability of an optional instrument in this area , formalised with a regulation and complemented with a ' toolbox ' , which would make it possible to ensure legal certainty and security . 
Such an instrument would make the Single Market run more smoothly , would benefit businesses and consumers , and would also be advantageous to the legal systems of the Member States themselves . 
For the above reasons , I voted for this report and I support a European Commission proposal on this matter , which should , in future , involve the European Parliament itself , as well as economic and civil-society stakeholders . 
The fact that we have 27 legal regimes is one of the most formidable barriers encountered by entrepreneurs and consumers in the EU who wish to take advantage of the benefits of the Internal Market . 
The work in progress on the establishment of an alternative EU contract law fills me with optimism , particularly in the context of the EU ' s Digital Agenda and e-commerce ' s potential for the Single Market . 
The rapporteur favours an optional instrument . 
Consumer protection organisations are already sceptical about the EU ' s approach to this topic . 
On the one hand , they question the causal link with the basis for future contract law , while also , more importantly , fearing a further complication of the legal situation . 
At present , a ' toolbox ' is the preferred option because this would meet current needs and special provisions in relation to the most common types of contract would be a genuine aid for consumers . 
However , all options should be kept open and examined at present . 
I voted in favour of the text presented by Mrs Wallis . 
The problems deriving from divergences in Member States ' contract laws often discourage businesses , in particular , small and medium-sized enterprises , from engaging in cross-border trade and keep them from benefiting from opportunities and gains which the Internal Market offers . 
The text voted on today aims to create an optional instrument for European contract law by means of a regulation . 
This optional instrument would stand alongside Member States ' contract laws as an alternative option which the contractual parties would be free to choose . 
Sixty percent of Internet transactions within the European Union fail , mainly due to the fact that the parties involved in such transactions are afraid of the unfamiliar legal systems of other Member States . 
In this situation , many EU citizens are deprived of the opportunity to take advantage of the online market . 
In this instance , the differences that exist between the legal systems of the Member States constitute a barrier to the proper functioning of the EU market . 
I therefore also believe that an optional instrument , or a ' 28th legal regime ' , stands a good chance of helping to unlock the potential of the European market in the field of e-commerce , and of helping to expand the market for entrepreneurs while guaranteeing equal access to goods and services for consumers . 
I am voting for this report because it includes a range of concerns highlighted by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament (S&D) , by acknowledging the limitations of gross domestic product (GDP) and the need to include additional indicators to measure economic and social progress in the medium and long terms . 
I would also draw attention to the establishment of clear and measurable indicators that take into account climate change , biodiversity , efficient resource utilisation and social inclusion , which could help lead to a more inclusive society based on knowledge , and to lower carbon emissions . 
I voted in favour of this resolution on GDP and beyond - Measuring progress in a changing world . 
GDP is an indicator of economic market activity that has become a standard benchmark used by policy makers throughout the world . 
It is necessary to emphasise that GDP is a measure of production and does not reflect environmental sustainability , resource efficiency , social inclusion or social progress in general . 
Furthermore , it can be misleading in the sense that remedial measures following certain incidents such as accidents and natural disasters are treated as a benefit instead of a cost . 
I therefore welcome the provision set out in the resolution that we need to develop additional indicators for measuring medium and long-term economic and social progress , and to establish clear and measurable indicators that provide information on climate change , biodiversity , resource efficiency and social inclusion . 
We also need to develop indicators that reflect the household level more accurately: income , consumption and wealth . 
It is therefore important to develop a tool to complement GDP . 
It should be developed so that it can be applied in a practical way , using clearly defined indicators and relying on high-quality data . 
Gross domestic product is the best known measure of macro-economic activity . 
It was developed in the 1930s and is used by political decision makers in discussions as an indicator of growth in their countries . 
In the light of the ever closer degree of interdependence between economic , social and environmental issues , GDP today suffers from many shortcomings , as it does not record important social factors such as well-being , social inclusion , climate change or resource efficiency . 
Therefore , in a context in which the correlation between a range of non-market activities and GDP is no longer automatic , there is a need to develop additional clear and measurable medium- and long-term indicators that ensure comparability between countries and regions and that can be used for projecting future developments and designing policies . 
I would like to support the adoption of a clearly defined measuring system which will go beyond GDP , in the sense of complementing GDP in the context of making and assessing decisions . 
GDP is an indicator of economic market activity which has become a benchmark used by policy makers . 
The need to improve data and indicators to complement GDP as part of assessing society ' s overall development is increasingly recognised by all international institutions . 
This report emphasises the need to measure the quality of life in societies . 
Achieving and sustaining quality of life involves important factors such as health , education , culture , employment , housing and environmental conditions . 
I support the establishment of a solid legal framework for European environmental economic accounts and encourage the need to compile reliable , harmonised statistics . 
in writing . - I voted in favour of this report because it stresses the importance of agreeing on a systemic approach to setting up a coherent ' Beyond GDP system ' to contribute to improved policy analysis . 
GDP is an indicator of economic activity that has become a standard benchmark used by policy makers throughout the world . 
But GDP is only a measure of production . 
It does not measure environmental sustainability , resource efficiency , social inclusion and social progress in general . 
Therefore , it can be misleading . 
We need to measure quality of life in societies; we need to consider that achieving and sustaining quality of life involves important , consensual factors such as health , education , culture , employment , housing , environmental conditions , etc . 
For these reasons , this report deserves to be given the highest consideration . 
It takes the view that indicators which measure such factors should be assigned a greater role . 
As the Stieglitz Committee demonstrated in France in 2008-2009 , we need to think of new development indicators to add to GDP . 
Hitherto a key reference , despite leading to possible errors of appreciation (for instance , the rebuilding that follows natural disasters is recorded as economic progress) , GDP on its own will no longer do . 
I voted for Mrs Rosbach ' s report since it calls on the Commission to continue its research in this area by challenging the reluctance of the Conservatives who believe that only GDP is reliable and the illusions of a section of the left who would like us to measure precisely . . . happiness ! 
The Commission ' s work will have to be closely monitored because it could lead to an important development: a new , more appropriate method of calculating how European funding is allocated to the regions (regional policy) . 
Until now , funding has been granted on the basis of GDP per person in the regions concerned . 
Gross domestic product (GDP) is an indicator of economic market activity that has become a standard benchmark used by policy makers throughout the world and is best known as a measure of macro-economic activity . 
GDP does not reflect current environmental sustainability , resource efficiency , social inclusion or social progress in general . 
I agree with the Commission ' s proposal to develop additional indicators for measuring medium and long-term economic and social progress , and to establish clear and measurable indicators that provide information on climate change , biodiversity , resource efficiency and social inclusion . 
For many years , GDP has been the main index for economic assessment , but its shortcomings are increasingly apparent when it comes to assessing social or environmental progress . 
Hence , the importance of this resolution which insists on the need for the European Union to adopt other indicators in addition to GDP in order to take better account of , among other things , climate change , biodiversity or even social integration , these being major political challenges that are close to my heart . 
I voted for this report because defining and implementing a new range of indicators is an important challenge for measuring the quality of life of European citizens more accurately , and improving the political answers that cannot be drawn up solely on the basis of GDP . 
I think that this initiative is the first encouraging step towards greater account being taken of social and environmental issues in European public policies . 
However , to be fully useful and effective , this will have to be followed by the genuine introduction of a new range of indicators as well as their effective and coherent political use , so that they are not turned into gimmicks but , well and truly , into genuine tools that help with decision making . 
Gross domestic product is the best known measure of macro-economic activity . 
It was developed in the 1930s and has come to take on the role of a comprehensive indicator for overall societal development and progress in general . 
A series of international initiatives highlighted broad support by policy makers and experts from the fields of economics , environmental protection and civil society for the development of indicators to complement GDP , providing more comprehensive information to support policy making . 
GDP does not , in fact , provide a reliable basis for policy debate . 
In particular , it does not measure environmental sustainability or social integration . 
In the political and scientific discussion that has been going on for years , I believe the problem is more about how this approach can be achieved using clearly defined and quantifiable indicators . 
At European and Member State level , there have been many initiatives to fill the gaps in these areas . 
Unfortunately , there are only partial signs of coherent action . 
Therefore , while I acknowledge the importance of adopting a clearly defined system for measuring GDP , I call on the Commission to submit , in the first instance , a tiered strategy that shows how the new ' Beyond GDP ' approach can be used in day-to-day political work . 
I welcome the Rosbach report because it clearly defines GDP as an indicator of the economic activity of the market and production in the relevant country , but which does not measure environmental sustainability , resource efficiency , social inclusion and social progress . 
A high GDP , even when calculated per capita , can be misleading because GDP is not distributed equally among the population , which is why it is not a good indicator of quality of life in a society . 
To enable us to cope with current and future problems , new indicators need to be devised which will complement and further refine GDP . 
This will allow us not only to define the quality of life more accurately , but these indicators will also provide a more reliable knowledge base , which will contribute to a better analysis of the policies in different areas . 
The report by Mrs Rosbach is a critical analysis of the Commission ' s communication ' GDP and beyond - Measuring progress in a changing world ' . 
While the Commission ' s aim - to adopt a measuring system that would go beyond gross domestic product to provide a more comprehensive picture of a country ' s progress and development , including , for example , environmental sustainability and social inclusion - is important and non-controversial , the rapporteur questions the strategy that the Commission is proposing to achieve it . 
The initiatives suggested are not , in fact , part of a tiered , pragmatic strategy indicating how the new ' Beyond GDP ' approach should be used . 
I share this view , and therefore I voted in favour of Mrs Rosbach ' s report . 
I voted for this report because I believe that it is only by using proper instruments that we can have a realistic view of the situation , and therefore do our best to change it if necessary . 
Gross domestic product , or GDP , is an instrument designed to indicate the aggregated added value of all money-based economic activities . 
It is easy to see how a wealth indicator based on dated parameters is anachronistic now , in 2011 . 
I believe we should introduce new indicators for measuring GDP , such as environmental sustainability and social inclusion , so that all the information making up GDP provides a truer picture of the country or region to which it refers . 
Adapting to the times means taking into consideration all the important variables , without falling into the trap of creating an excessively artificial system , which would be difficult to apply . 
I believe that , with clearly defined indicators , the work can be carried out in the best possible way . 
Although gross domestic product (GDP) is a measurement of production that is useful for economic market activity , it does not take into account the sustainability of the development demonstrated , or environmental and social aspects , etc . 
I therefore welcome the ' GDP and beyond - Measuring progress in a changing world ' initiative , which aims to encourage and raise awareness of the use of other complementary GDP indicators when evaluating and discussing politics . 
I believe this system of measurement based on corroborating various study parameters will lead to political decisions more suited to the needs of society and the economy in general . 
in writing . - While academics will argue over the best possible way to measure progress , we as European legislatures must be confident in the method we pick and ensure that it stands up to argument both today and in the future . 
Economic literature has been asking for years whether it is necessary to continue using the rate of growth of GDP as an indicator of the progress made by a geographic area over a given period of time . 
I believe that there is currently no other indicator that is as concise or complete . 
We cannot present our citizens , who are caught up in their own everyday problems , with a clinical file describing the state of the economy . 
At the same time , we cannot insist exclusively on strictly economic indicators , which are not always able to pick up on social phenomena . 
I therefore agree with the report ' s general objective . 
We should join forces with the international academic community and try to move beyond GDP . 
There are plenty of examples all over the world , from the UN Human Development Index to Bhutan ' s Gross National Happiness index . 
It is necessary to identify the priority objectives and measure their achievement strictly , accurately and in a way that cannot be distorted by vested interests . 
We need to remember that it does not matter how many watches we have , but how we spend our time . 
I voted for this report because I think that indicators need to be found to complement GDP and help us measure factors such as climate change , biodiversity or resource efficiency . 
As Joseph Stiglitz expressed it so well , GDP is not only an instrument which is inadequate for reflecting citizens ' welfare , but it is also restricted to measuring economic market activity . 
I hope that the European executive will come up with specific proposals for additional , more extensive and sustainable indicators so as to remedy the current shortcomings . 
Indicators are a concise way of interpreting a given phenomenon . 
Simple phenomena can be interpreted using simple indicators , while complex phenomena require complex indicators . 
Gross domestic product is a simple indicator , while development is a complex phenomenon . 
Indeed , the economic development of an area has various dimensions that are not included in GDP , which takes a snapshot of a given moment . 
Other elements of interpretation are totally neglected , such as investment in intangible infrastructure , including know-how (people , processes and products , to mention just a few examples) , and investment in tangible infrastructure , including communication and transport networks (ICT networks and road and rail networks , for example) . 
In addition , GDP is not even suitable for identifying regions assisted by EU regional cohesion policy . 
For these reasons , the European Commission ' s efforts to go beyond GDP and create a series of data and indicators that will improve its ability to interpret phenomena and help to better define policies and financial allocations should be commended . 
The report that we have adopted seems to me to be moving in this direction . 
in writing . - GDP (gross domestic product) is the aggregated added value of all money-based economic activities . 
It is the most widely known and used measure of macro-economic activity . 
Indeed , GDP has become the primary indicator for overall societal development and progress in general . 
There is growing international recognition of the inadequacy of GDP as an indicator of social progress , social inclusion , environmental sustainability and resource efficiency . 
I support this report which calls for the development of clear and measurable indicators that take account of climate change , biodiversity , resource efficiency and social inclusion . 
It further underlines the need to measure quality of life in societies , considering that achieving and sustaining quality of life involves important , consensual factors such as health , education , culture , employment , housing , and environmental conditions . 
It also fully supports the establishment of a solid legal framework for the European Environmental Economic Accounts as a positive step in the ' GDP and beyond ' process , and , indeed , welcomes the Commission initiative to present an index for environmental pressure , to be submitted alongside GDP . 
Despite all the more or less sentimental constructions that we might make , the truth is that it is by analysing gross domestic product (GDP) that we can achieve a reliable image of societies ' state of development and progress . 
That is why GDP is - and should continue to be - the main economic indicator to be taken into account . 
However , it should be complemented , wherever appropriate , with other indicators , which should be studied and introduced gradually . 
In 2007 , the European Parliament , alongside the Commission , the Club of Rome , the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) , organised a conference on the theme of ' Beyond GDP ' , at which those involved advocated the need to develop other indicators complementary to gross domestic product (GDP) . 
This report , by Mrs Rosbach , is based on a communication tabled by the Commission on 28 September 2009 called ' GDP and beyond - Measuring progress in a changing world ' , and it reflects this need to provide politicians and researchers with data that is more comprehensive . 
Over recent decades , gross domestic product (GDP) has been the most-used unit of macro-economic measurement , and has started to be used most recently as an indicator of social development . 
A number of sociologists have been arguing , most recently , that this is not the best indicator as it does not consider aspects such as sustainability or social integration . 
Since I agree with the rapporteur ' s position , I voted for her report , but I believe that the proposal can , and must , be improved by tabling a strategy that is more comprehensive and gradual . 
The neoliberal guidelines and policies implemented by the EU have endangered social progress and inflicted severe blows on Europe ' s peoples . 
The exacerbation of social inequalities in the countries of the EU , which are currently reaching worrying levels , is a telling example of this . 
This is something we should keep in mind when we analyse development and progress indicators , as this report does . 
Gross domestic product (GDP) is frequently used as a basis for assessing these two factors - development and progress - and is a statistical indicator with natural shortcomings . 
By taking into account only economic activity - wealth creation - and being useful , therefore , in determining economic growth , it does not cover parameters as important as wealth distribution , social inequalities , the quality of goods and services , non-commercial transactions or even outcomes not recorded by the market , which are essential to the assessment of development and progress . 
In many situations , GDP can increase while the majority of a country ' s citizens become poorer , because GDP does not take into consideration the level of inequality in a society . 
For all these reasons , it becomes necessary to take into account any other indicators that might overcome these shortcomings so as to make social progress measures as complete , credible and close to reality as possible . 
There are increasingly large economic divergences and social inequalities caused by the EU ' s neoliberal guidelines and policies , and by the increasingly unfair sharing and distribution of national income , both at EU level and at national level . 
It is therefore increasingly controversial to use gross domestic product (GDP) as a basis for working with social development and progress , and a statistical indicator for measuring them . 
It is a statistical indicator with many shortcomings , since it takes into account only economic activity , leaving aside other important factors like wealth distribution , social inequalities , the quality of goods and services , non-commercial transactions or even outcomes not recorded by the market . 
This means that , in many situations , GDP can increase while the majority of a country ' s citizens become poorer , because GDP does not take into consideration the level of inequality in a society . 
As such , we are able to consider it acceptable to take into account other indicators that might complement these shortcomings so as to make social progress measures as complete , credible and close to reality as possible . 
GDP has become an indicator of social development and progress generally . 
It is not , however , a measure of environmental sustainability or social inclusion . 
With regard to the need to improve this data and the indicators , the Commission has released a communication entitled ' GDP and beyond: Measuring progress in a changing world ' . 
In this communication , it proposes , for example , creating comprehensive indicators which would provide a more reliable knowledge base . 
I believe it is necessary to create an instrument that can supplement GDP , taking account of the fact that it must have a practical application , use clearly defined indicators and rely on high-quality data . 
The Commission ' s objective of going beyond gross domestic product and finding another measuring system (which would still incorporate GDP) is rightly criticised in the parliamentary report , which emphasises the fact that if the Commission has not yet clearly defined the changeover or accurate indicators , the debate will have to be postponed . 
I therefore voted in favour of the motion . 
Gross domestic product is the best known measure of macro-economic activity and is used in political analysis and discussions worldwide to indicate social development . 
Unfortunately , despite being widely used , there is a growing awareness that the economic and social fabric in Europe has profoundly changed . 
Nowadays , in addition to information about income and wealth , other indicators of an environmental nature influence the quality of life in a country and can no longer be ignored . 
This is why I support the report by Mrs Rosbach , which draws up new indicators taking account of major strands of environmental policy such as energy use , biodiversity , water use and waste generation . 
The challenge lies in integrating existing indices with other elements that are politically relevant and empirically measurable , and which provide reliable statistics on the future development of countries . 
In this sense , I believe that by eliminating subjective factors such as personal happiness , which cannot be considered to be indicators , the new text has reached a good compromise . 
Finally , I hope that both Eurostat and the Eurobarometer will play a major role in this innovative process . 
Thank you for your attention . 
I welcomed the report because GDP is an indicator of economic market activity that has become a standard benchmark used by policy makers throughout the world . 
However , GDP is a measure of production and does not reflect environmental sustainability , resource efficiency , social inclusion or social progress in general . 
Furthermore , it can be misleading in the sense that remedial measures following certain incidents such as accidents and natural disasters are treated as a benefit instead of a cost . 
We need to develop additional indicators for measuring medium and long-term economic and social progress . 
I feel that we need to establish clear and measurable indicators that provide information on climate change , biodiversity , resource efficiency and social inclusion , as well as indicators that reflect the household level more accurately: income , consumption and wealth . 
There is also a need to measure quality of life in societies , because in order to ensure and sustain quality of life , it is necessary to take into account important , consensual factors such as health , education , culture , employment , housing , environmental conditions , etc . 
Indicators which measure such factors should be assigned a greater role . 
The further development of qualitative and quantitative metrics should be based on the European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS) indicators , covering the core areas of quality of life . 
I share the rapporteur ' s analysis in the report voted on today . 
Gross domestic product no longer seems able to meet growing economic and political requirements . 
I think it is necessary to find a complementary system which could contribute to improved policy analysis and debate through the use of clear supplementary indicators for measuring medium- and long-term economic and social progress . 
This will certainly not be an easy task , given the delicate nature of the matter and the potential impacts of decisions taken in this context . 
The challenge we are preparing to embrace therefore lies in finding reliable indicators that are theoretically consistent , politically relevant and empirically measurable . 
GDP is the most effective instrument for measuring macro-economic activity , while also serving as an indirect indicator of social development and progress . 
However , it cannot provide information about all the areas which are the subject of political debates , such as the environment and social inclusion . 
This indicator underpins many of the European Union ' s policy decisions and instruments . 
I think that we need to step up our efforts to provide indicators which will meet the needs of all citizens . 
They specifically need to measure in a sustainable manner the progress made in achieving economic , social and environmental objectives . 
In conclusion , future European policies need to be based on complete , up-to-date data , covering all the vital aspects . 
in writing . - I welcome this report which stresses that GDP is an indicator of economic market activity that has become a standard benchmark used by policy makers throughout the world; emphasises that GDP is a measure of production and does not measure environmental sustainability , resource efficiency , social inclusion and social progress in general; underlines furthermore that it can be misleading in the sense that remedial measures following certain incidents such as accidents and natural disasters are treated as a benefit instead of a cost; notes that besides measuring economic development and productivity , there are other indicators that influence and explain the living standards in a country and that have not been quantified until now , although relevant indicators exist; stresses the need to develop additional indicators for measuring the full impact of economic activity . 
Nowadays , gross domestic product is no longer a sufficient , appropriate indicator for measuring progress , and it is therefore necessary to develop more comprehensive indicators that would provide a more reliable knowledge base in an ever changing world . 
There is often a lack of clearly defined information , data and indicators . 
At European and Member State level , there have been many initiatives to fill the gaps highlighted . 
Although it is difficult to develop a method that is coherent at the same time , we believe that what is required is a comprehensive concept , taking account of existing measures , which can be implemented in practice . 
It is important to develop a new tool that can complement GDP , that has practical use , that is based on clearly defined indicators , and that relies on data of a high quality . 
We agree with the rapporteur that it is necessary to submit a tiered strategy that should show how the new approach can be used pragmatically in day-to-day political work . 
I voted for the report on GDP and beyond - Measuring progress in a changing world , by Mrs Rosbach , because I believe that gross domestic product is no longer a sufficient , appropriate indicator for measuring progress in a changing world , and it is therefore necessary to develop more comprehensive indicators that would provide a more reliable knowledge base . 
It should be remembered that GDP is a measure of production and does not measure environmental sustainability for example . 
It is necessary to develop other indicators that will help explain which factors influence the living standards in a country . 
I am therefore in favour of the creation of additional indicators for measuring medium- and long-term social and economic progress , for example , indicators that take account of climate change , biodiversity , resource efficiency and social inclusion . 
The development of these new indicators will help to understand and measure the quality of life in societies . 
Therefore , the development of a Member State or region cannot be assessed solely by an economic indicator such as GDP: quality of life , which is determined by factors such as health , education , culture , employment , housing and climate and environmental conditions , must also be taken into account . 
As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy for this report , I believe that achieving and sustaining quality of life involves important , interlinked factors such as health , education , culture , jobs , housing and environmental conditions . 
I therefore believe that the indicators measuring these factors are also important , and that more importance should be attached to them . 
I voted in favour because this report is a step , albeit a hesitant one , towards improving and complementing gross domestic product (GDP) as an instrument for the measurement and evaluation of social and economic performance , and , by association , of the progress of societies . 
We all agree that there is a need to improve data and indicators to complement gross domestic product (GDP) for overall societal development . 
The ' GDP and beyond - Measuring progress in a changing world ' initiative is a complementary instrument capable of contributing to improving analysis and political debate . 
GDP is an indicator of market economic activity that has become the standard point of reference at the service of the world ' s decision makers . 
GDP is a measure of production that does not measure environmental sustainability , resource efficiency , social inclusion and social progress in general . 
I therefore agree that in the future , other types of instruments should be studied that allow for a greater number of reliable data for measuring a world that is changing . 
in writing . - It is known that GDP (gross domestic product) is the aggregated added value of all money-based economic activities . 
GDP is the expression of a production / consumption-based society and does not take into account changes and assets in important fields . 
Taking into account the need for improved data and indicators to complement GDP , various measures are suggested that would provide a more reliable knowledge base . 
The need to develop additional indicators for measuring medium- and long-term economic and social progress is highly urgent . 
I voted in favour . 
Today , the European Parliament adopted a resolution on GDP and beyond - measuring progress in a changing world . 
Gross domestic product is a widely used index for measuring social development and economic progress . 
However , its universality raises doubts as to whether it fails to take into account a series of indicators which are crucial for quality of life in a given country . 
There are also some significant parameters which are interpreted incorrectly . 
The Commission has suggested that it is essential to develop an indicator which clearly depicts the situation in the country in question , and which also reflects the situation of households and individuals , as well as how efficiently the country ' s resources are exploited and the state of the environment . 
The Commission expects greater involvement from the Member States in terms of systematising research into the quality of public life , which would make it possible for clear comparisons to be made between countries . 
A coherent policy would result in it being easier to analyse research , and also in it being possible to predict the potential long-term development of countries . 
I voted in favour of this resolution on GDP and other indicators aimed at measuring progress and the general development of society . 
GDP is an indicator of economic market activity that has become a standard benchmark used by policy makers throughout the world . 
However , this indicator is not holistic . 
It does not reflect environmental sustainability , resource efficiency , social inclusion or social progress . 
Moreover , in certain cases , GDP may provide inaccurate and misleading information . 
Consequently , we must make every effort to develop additional medium and long-term indicators for measuring the factors mentioned and the household level . 
I welcome the proposal that when measuring quality of life for society , much attention should be paid to health , education , culture , employment , housing and other similar factors , relating to the core areas of quality of life . 
Thus , we must find means of developing an appropriate and effective tool to complement GDP , which could be applied in a practical way , using clearly defined indicators and relying on high-quality data . 
 ' GDP and beyond - Measuring progress in a changing world ' is a report that aims to assess levels of progress in the European Union through gross domestic product , which has taken on the role of a comprehensive indicator for societal and economic development . 
Unfortunately , however , it no longer provides a reliable basis for policy debate because it does not measure environmental sustainability or social integration . 
There is increasing awareness of the need for improved data and indicators to complement progress assessment criteria . 
For this reason , I voted for a text that tries to integrate development in the European Union with new social indicators , seeks a clearly defined measurement system that goes beyond GDP , and complements it in the context of decision making . 
I voted for this report entitled ' GDP and beyond - Measuring progress in a changing world ' . 
As the report rightly says , gross domestic product (GDP) , which is used by political decision makers worldwide and referred to in public debates , has also come to take on the role of a comprehensive indicator for overall societal development and progress in general . 
However , it does not provide a reliable basis for policy debate on every issue . 
For example , GDP does not measure environmental sustainability or social integration . 
In the Commission communication on ' GDP and beyond - measuring progress in a changing world ' , various measures are suggested as suitable ways to complement GDP . 
In particular , it focuses on developing more comprehensive indicators that would provide a more reliable knowledge base . 
I would express my support for the Commission ' s intention to adopt a clearly defined measuring system that would go beyond GDP , in the sense that it complements GDP in the context of decision making and assessment , using clearly defined and quantifiable indicators . 
Gross domestic product is the best known measure worldwide . 
It has come to take on the role of a comprehensive indicator for overall societal development and progress in general , but does not take into account or measure environmental sustainability or social integration . 
There is a need for improved data and indicators to complement GDP , or else it will not provide a reliable basis for policy debate . 
This issue has already been discussed in prior years and particularly in 2007 , when the European Parliament and the Commission , together with various bodies and associations , held a conference entitled ' Beyond GDP ' . 
At this conference , the Commission considered that GDP is not a suitable long-term measurement system , just as economic and social progress are not sufficient to assess issues such as climate change , resource efficiency or personal well-being . 
New indicators were subsequently proposed for measuring progress in the achievement of social , economic and environmental objectives . 
For the above reasons , and in order to be able to develop a clear and comprehensive set of indicators that are , at the same time , consistent , relevant and objectively measurable , I voted for the motion being discussed . 
The Commission Communication ' GDP and beyond - Measuring progress in a changing world ' focuses on developing more comprehensive indicators to complement GDP , which will provide a more reliable knowledge base . 
GDP has come to take on the role of a comprehensive indicator for measuring society ' s overall development and progress , but it does not provide a reliable basis for policy debate on every issue . 
In particular , GDP does not measure the level of environmental sustainability or social integration . 
I voted for this report because it is important that we develop a tool which can complement GDP , taking into account that it has to be done in a way so that it can have practical use , based on clearly defined indicators and high-quality data . 
This report calls on the Commission to submit a tiered strategy for the ' Beyond GDP ' approach which should explain how the new approach can be used pragmatically in day-to-day political activities . 
I believe that achieving and sustaining quality of life involves important , interlinked factors such as health , education , culture , jobs , housing and environmental condition . 
I therefore believe that the indicators measuring these factors are also important , and that more importance should be attached to them . 
I voted in favour because this report is a step , albeit a hesitant one , towards improving and complementing gross domestic product (GDP) as an instrument for the measurement and evaluation of social and economic performance , and , by association , of societies ' progress . 
Gross domestic product (GDP) is the standard macro-economic indicator , used , as a rule , to measure the economies of various states . 
Nevertheless , it is merely an indicator of wealth , with less potential for comparing social development . 
The success of GDP is due , to a large extent , to its simplicity at the cost , therefore , of the completeness of the results attained . 
It would be useful , therefore , to develop new indicators that enable other aspects of the reality to be sounded out , in order to obtain a better overall view of countries ' development . 
It is a complex process which should involve professionals from all areas , in order to obtain a broader and more complete indicator . 
I support this . 
As my colleague , Mrs Bélier , has said , although this report could have gone further with the ambitions and guidelines that it could have set , it does represent a first step and a strong signal sent out to the Council and the Commission for Europe to press ahead with an overhaul of the wealth and development indicators so as to make them more representative of the environmental and social realities and constraints with which we are confronted . 
With this decision , MEPs recognise the need to go beyond and abandon an outdated model , which brings about social inequality and destroys the natural heritage , in order to start a new economic model on a European level . 
It paves the way for the recognition of new indicators that are fairer and that will allow us to undertake the ecological and social transition of our societies . 
This report proposes the adoption of a clearly defined measuring system that would complement gross domestic product as an indicator of overall social development . 
The complementary tool should have practical use and be based on clearly defined indicators and reliable data . 
Only in this way can GDP make a sufficient contribution to policy debate and decision making . 
The Commission is therefore invited to present a comprehensive , tiered strategy that should show how the new approach can be used pragmatically in day-to-day political work . 
The report on the Commission communication of 20 August 2009 on ' GDP and Beyond - Measuring progress in a changing world ' highlights the importance of gross domestic product as a comprehensive indicator of social development and economic growth . 
The objective is to adopt a new clearly defined and quantifiable measuring system based on reliable , accurate data , but the Commission ' s communication does not indicate the tiered strategy for delivering it . 
I voted in favour of the report as I believe it is important to carry out socio-economic analyses using appropriate tools that will complement GDP . 
in writing . - I support this report , which recommends several concrete actions , including the creation of an environmental index , more timely publication of environmental and social data , more accurate reporting on social disparities and extending the system of national accounts to include environmental and social issues . 
In the Commission communication to the European Parliament and the Council entitled ' GDP and beyond - Measuring progress in a changing world ' (COM(2009) 433 final) , it is acknowledged that ' GDP has also come to be regarded as a proxy indicator for overall societal development and progress in general ' but ' does not measure environmental sustainability or social inclusion ' . 
In a world in which people ' s quality of life is increasingly measured using other , non-economic factors , various international institutions , like the United Nations (UN) , the World Bank and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) , are currently studying the definition of new indicators , so as to measure and analyse economic and social progress . 
As such , I voted for this report , as I believe it is important for the European Union to implement a systematic approach in order to measure social welfare in all its aspects , giving particular emphasis to economic and environmental factors , and to improving quality of life in the medium and long term . 
I believe that the aforementioned indicators will take on a strategic importance in the definition of future cohesion policy , thereby contributing to smart , sustainable and inclusive growth , in line with the principles enshrined in the Europe 2020 strategy . 
I voted in favour of the report on GDP and beyond - Measuring progress in a changing world , for the following reasons . 
Everyone knows that GDP is an indicator used to measure macro-economic activity and cannot be used to measure other things . 
Consequently , new indicators need to be developed , which is precisely what Mrs Rosbach ' s report does . 
I consider that GDP is a limited indicator and that indicators should be developed to supplement it . 
The report addresses the above issues , which I consider to be very important and in need of immediate resolution , which is why I voted in favour of this particular report . 
I voted in favour of the identification of new parameters more representative of a country ' s progress , and not just its consumption , although I think more should be done . 
The report in question has had a long and difficult journey , and finally made it to the plenary session having lost much of its content along the way . 
Parliament should have put forward a proposal taking into account factors including education , health and personal activities , but it confined itself to highlighting the need to establish new parameters , delegating the task of defining them to the Commission . 
Gross domestic product is an outdated indicator based on economic principles that , by reducing quality to quantity , overlook the meaning of things and individual and collective well-being , undervalue work in itself compared to the object of production , and consider only the production of new objects , not maintenance . 
If we cast a glance at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) GDP scale (the EU is in first place , Lithuania is 82nd) , we can see that GDP does not tell the entire story . 
GDP does not sufficiently reflect the complex socio-economic reality of national and regional challenges . 
Although GDP is a strong macro-economic indicator , it does not reflect Lithuania ' s greatest social problems , such as unemployment , the quality of education and health care systems and disparities in income distribution . 
In Lithuania , and at EU level , there is often a lack of clear information , data and indicators , and I therefore support the rapporteur ' s proposal to provide a better report on social indicators . 
I hope that this will provide more comprehensive information for developing policies . 
Nowadays , unfortunately , politicians often do not have such information . 
The development of EU policies should not be purely based on abstract statistics . 
Above all , EU policy should be measured by the progress made in improving the well-being of Europeans . 
The ' Beyond GDP ' method mentioned in this report may prove very useful . 
However , before implementing it , we should find out more about the possibilities of adapting the new method in everyday life . 
I am voting for this report because it is a thorough evaluation of the process and implementation to date and because it launches a debate on its future governance , exploitation and financing of the decision to create global navigation satellite systems and other autonomous European systems . 
This includes all commercial aspects of the exploitation as well as the legal , contractual and financing structures of the different exploitation models that will guarantee that the governance model is put into practice . 
The Galileo programme (satellite navigation) is extremely important as it enables the European Union to be competent in cutting-edge technologies . 
Unfortunately , Galileo is facing additional delays and costs . 
Faced with this situation , it is essential that we consider new solutions . 
This is why I supported Mr Remek ' s report , which is aimed at looking into all the possible sources of funding on top of the contribution from the European budget . 
Galileo , together with EGNOS (European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service , an augmentation system that improves the accuracy and the reliability of the US Global Positioning System (GPS) information) , is the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) developed by the EU . 
When completed , it is expected to consist of 27 satellites plus a suitable number of spare satellites in orbit at an altitude of approximately 23 000 km above the surface of the earth , and a worldwide network of approximately 40 ground stations . 
The EU decided to set up its own global navigation satellite system for two key reasons: firstly , Europe ' s independence from other global navigation systems and autonomy , and secondly , to gain a share in this fast growing worldwide high-tech market , which today , to a large extent , is dominated by the US . 
I agree that there should be a broad and comprehensive debate at political level about the desired level of ambition (deciding the level of services provided) and the financial resources available (whereby a political choice would need to be made between a purely EU funded programme and one allowing national or private contributions) . 
The result of this debate will impact the policy options for the future governance and management of the GNSS systems . 
The project to implement a European satellite navigation programme is a major challenge and undoubtedly useful for the future of technology in Europe , but the forecasts of expenditure and investment by the European bodies for this project are still not clear or transparent at present . 
Further expenditure is expected in a few years ' time , in addition to that initially planned by the programme , and I believe it is likely that additional sums will be needed to complete the project . 
I therefore abstained from the final vote on the own-initiative report . 
in writing . - (FR) It is with satisfaction that I voted in favour of this report , which is the culmination of a far-reaching political decision , particularly regarding the implementation of Galileo . 
It is absolutely crucial that the European autonomous satellite radionavigation system be commissioned as soon as possible and , as the report highlights , with long-term funding guarantees . 
Competition from the United States (with the Global Positioning System - GPS) requires us to introduce Galileo quickly , bearing in mind what is at stake economically , technically , politically and strategically . 
The European Union has set itself the objective of becoming the world leader in Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) with the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) and Galileo programmes , thus ensuring its technological independence from American GPS . 
Considering the significant economic returns from such programmes , I voted in favour of the Remek report which calls on the Commission and the Member States to ensure sufficient funding in order to make sure these projects are completed by 2018 , thus asserting themselves as credible challengers to the American system . 
in writing . - At a time when the Commission , and indeed this Parliament , ought to be searching for , and bringing forward , proposals on how to save money , we are offered this report which suggests the completion of the Galileo satellite navigation system at an additional cost of EUR 1 . 9 billion in the next Multiannual Financial Framework . 
Let us not forget that this is against a backdrop where the Galileo satellite project started off with a budget of EUR 7 . 7 billion and is now projected to cost EUR 22 . 6 billion . 
To such a proposal , I categorically say no . 
Current budget lines already in place for this project are easily sufficient to bring about its completion , yet - true to form - the suggestion is to spend even more . 
I know that if I speak to my constituents , they will give little support to the current spending on Galileo , let alone an increase . 
Again , I urge MEPs and the Commission to be realistic and to be cautious with the money we have and with which we should aim to bring maximum benefit to our constituents . 
European satellite navigation systems have been causing delays and additional costs , which should lead those responsible to give thought to the patterns currently being followed for their implementation . 
At a time when countries like Portugal are resorting to aid from the other Member States , and when Europe is , as such , facing a serious economic and financial crisis that threatens its stability , an even greater effort should be made to avoid cost overruns and excessive expense . 
I am not questioning the strategic importance of these projects , but I cannot fail to highlight that they have been falling short of expectations . 
I agree that , as both Galileo and the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) are European programmes and are in the common public interest of the Union , they should , overall , be financed through the EU budget , but I think that other possible sources should be weighed up , including innovative forms of financing . 
This report , drafted by Mr Remek , deals with European satellite navigation programmes . 
It is a report whose purpose is a mid-term review of these programmes , including assessment of their implementation , future challenges and financial perspectives . 
Since 2000 , when the Global Positioning System (GPS) service was made available , this sector has grown exponentially (EUR 124 billion in 2008) , with the domestic market forecast to be worth EUR 230 billion overall in 2025 . 
In 2008 , the EU decided to create its own satellite navigation system (Regulation (EC) No 683 / 2008) , Galileo and the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) , with the objective of ensuring Europe ' s independence and autonomy , raising its market share and putting the industry in a position to be competitive in a strategic and fast-growing market . 
I voted in favour of the rapporteur ' s proposals , in spite of the cost overruns recorded in the implementation of the project , because I understand that the EU should be at the forefront of researching and developing cutting-edge technology , especially when that same technology represents a scientific and economic asset to the EU . 
As we have said regarding the application of a global European satellite navigation system for transport , the use of this technology could represent an important contribution to the development , modernisation and diversification of public services , in the creation of opportunities for cooperation , and progress in science and its applications , and in the exchange and accessibility of information , with the guarantee of respect for the public ' s rights , freedoms and guarantees . 
The issue at stake , however , is not that of the existence of a global navigation satellite system for Europe based on use for non-military ends and not integrated into the EU ' s security arrangements . 
The problem is its potential use for military and aggressive ends . 
In particular , the fact that this satellite navigation system being set up in competition with the Global Positioning System (GPS) of the United States , on which the EU depends , and which is well known to be under military control , with financing from US federal military programmes , is worrying . 
We are therefore reaffirming our doubts about the limits to the potential uses of these programmes in a context of assumed EU-US competition regarding the functionalities and efficiencies of these systems . 
The issue at stake is not that of the existence of a global navigation satellite system for Europe based on use for non-military ends and not integrated into the EU ' s security arrangements . 
The problem is its potential use for military and aggressive ends . 
Its use for non-military ends could represent an important contribution to the provision of public services , with opportunities for cooperation , and progress in science and its applications , and in the exchange and accessibility of information , with the guarantee of respect for the public ' s rights , freedoms and guarantees . 
However , the fact that this satellite navigation system has been set up in competition with the Global Positioning System (GPS) of the United States , on which the EU depends , and which is well known to be under military control , with financing from US federal military programmes , is worrying . 
As such , we still have serious doubts about the limits to the potential uses of these programmes in a context of competition , both between functionalities and efficiencies of these systems , and between the EU and US . 
The European Union has taken the important step of introducing , through its political decision based on Regulation (EC) No 683 / 2008 , an autonomous European Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) , owned and operated by the Union . 
The Commission should produce a comprehensive analysis aimed at securing a more precise description of possible scenarios and resources in terms of operation and use after 2013 . 
It will include all commercial aspects of use , such as the legal , contractual and financial structures of the various models of usage , ensuring the establishment of a stable model of administration . 
in writing . - Galileo , Europe ' s own global navigation satellite system , is of great importance to Europe and , in particular , the UK . 
This project , which I fully support , has not only received significant public funding but private industry throughout the EU is also investing money , time and expertise into developing this system . 
However , despite recognising the need to push forward with this , I felt the need to abstain on the final vote . 
Mr Remek ' s report suggests completing the Galileo system will require additional funding of up to EUR 1 . 9 billion in the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) . 
In this current difficult financial climate , I have to oppose this increase in spending , especially considering that the programme is already 60% over budget . 
I believe that Galileo must stay within its current budget . 
Let us look at how we can improve the current system within the means that we have . 
I would strongly urge the Commission to take robust action to improve its programme management and to achieve savings . 
In order to do so , the Commission must undertake a thorough and comprehensive impact assessment , so that we can make an informed decision regarding the future funding of the programme . 
I welcomed this document because this report is a response to the Commission ' s Communication on the mid-term review of the autonomous European Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) (Galileo and EGNOS) , which assesses the process and implementation so far and launches the debate on its future governance , exploitation and financing . 
The EU decided to set up its own global navigation satellite system for two key reasons: firstly , Europe ' s independence from other global navigation systems and autonomy , and secondly , to gain a share in this fast growing worldwide high-tech market , which today , to a large extent , is dominated by the US . 
Indirect benefits of the programme are estimated to be around EUR 60 billion per year (including the downstream and upstream market and public benefits) . 
GNSS is seen as a disruptive technology , with high potential to create innovations , build up a high-tech knowledge base and increase productivity in many sectors . 
Annual growth rates of the market for GNSS-enabled products and services are estimated to be above 10% . 
The Commission should launch a comprehensive analysis to identify more precisely the possible scenarios and means of operation and exploitation post 2013 . 
This includes all commercial aspects of the exploitation as well as the legal , contractual and financing structures of the different exploitation models that will ensure that a stable governance model is put in place . 
The EGNOS and Galileo systems , when they are completed , will increase security in transport , using certain applications . 
These applications also represent the growing global markets from which the EU will benefit financially . 
The development of these systems will make an essential contribution to the development of European aviation transport and to a more economical and efficient system of rail and road transport . 
A problem for the development of these applications and for completing the systems on time may be a lack of investment . 
It is important to see the benefit to the Member States of investment and of developing the systems so that they are completed on schedule . 
I voted in favour of Mrs Ţicău ' s report because the project under examination meets many expectations of those looking to developments in research and technology with optimism . 
EGNOS and Galileo are projects that will generate approximately EUR 60 billion of indirect benefits to the European Union economy and society , in the form of enhanced road and aviation security , reduced air pollution and pesticide consumption , new jobs and public safety , generating very significant value for money . 
Therefore , before a decision is made on a further financial commitment from the EU budget in the next Multiannual Financial Framework , a clear assessment of all the possible technical options and related costs and benefits needs to be presented by the Commission . 
Ten years ago , the European Union launched two satellite navigation programmes: Galileo and EGNOS (European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service) . 
The first will be operational in 2014 and will be accurate to within less than a metre , whereas GPS is accurate to within several metres . 
This technological progress will enable European companies to innovate and position themselves at the cutting edge of services made possible by global positioning . 
However , there is also a strategic dimension to Galileo . 
At present , Europe is dependent on the GPS system , which is American . 
When Galileo is in place , the Union will enjoy total independence as well as superiority in this area , and it is plain to see the importance of the applications . 
The civilian and military resources of the Member States will be much more effective as a result . 
I voted for this resolution which , while praising the technical success , reminds the European Commission of the points where the programme can be improved: funding , public awareness , and involving our international partners . 
in writing . - The main challenge for the international activities of the GNSS Programmes will be to ensure the compatibility and interoperability with Galileo , to access global GNSS-related resources and set worldwide standards , to ensure security of the space segment and network of ground stations , while ensuring a stricter control of sensitive GNSS technologies developed with European funding , and to join in an international effort to develop innovative applications and specialised applications of supra-regional interest . 
An important objective will be to create market opportunities for the European GNSS technology and applications industries . 
We believe that the EU ' s Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) , consisting of the Galileo and EGNOS programmes , is an important step for Europe , firstly , as it ensures its autonomy and independence from other global navigation systems and , secondly , as it enables it to claim a share of this booming worldwide high-tech market . 
It is very important , however , that continuity of service is guaranteed , as a (temporary) limitation or degradation of GPS signals will have tremendous effects on our economy and society , without other independent GNSS systems in place . 
Nevertheless , to fully exploit its advantages , Galileo needs to reach full operating capacity , and to do so will require additional investment . 
Currently , the financial picture is anything but positive . 
On this point , we think that a broad and comprehensive political debate should take place about the desired level of ambition and the financial resources available . 
Finally , we maintain that it is important to launch a comprehensive analysis to obtain a more precise identification of the possible scenarios and means for operation and exploitation after 2013 , which includes all commercial aspects of the exploitation as well as the legal , contractual and financing structures of the different exploitation models that will ensure that a stable governance model is put into place . 
The European satellite navigation programmes , Galileo and the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) , will enable Europe to establish autonomy and strategic independence from other economic blocs , which is very important , and will contribute to improving the lives of the European public , as well as bringing direct and indirect benefits to the European economy . 
However , the problems financing these programmes could cause significant delays in their implementation , along with the inherent damage . 
We have to implement a medium- to long-term financing strategy in order for it to be possible to create the necessary market confidence and , consequently , to attract investment and the purchase of applications and services . 
Only a fully functional Galileo and EGNOS system will be an asset to the EU , in all its policies , not least in transport , in agriculture , in the fight against climate change , in the prevention of natural and man-made disasters , and in the area of science , technology and innovation . 
The European Parliament has always supported the European Union ' s Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) , implemented by means of the Galileo and the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) programmes . 
Unfortunately , today , the European Union is dependent on the Global Positioning System (GPS) of the United States . 
Nonetheless , Galileo offers clear advantages over the GPS system . 
Furthermore , EGNOS is used on a daily basis by 80 000 European farmers and has recently been certified for civil aviation , and should shortly be certified for maritime transport . 
Space policy and the GNSS programme are of strategic importance and should provide tangible benefits for citizens and businesses . 
From this point of view , the Commission must ensure the compatibility and interoperability of Galileo with other satellite navigation systems . 
Finally , it is important that these European programmes receive the funding they need to be brought to fruition . 
in writing . - The EU took an important step with its political decision . 
The report is a mid-term review of this flagship initiative , assessing the process and implementation so far and launching the debate on its future governance , exploitation and financing in the EU system . 
In my view , it is necessary to launch a comprehensive analysis to obtain a more precise identification of the possible scenarios and means for operation and exploitation after 2013 . 
I fully support the report of Vladimir Remek and I voted in favour . 
The GNSS (Galileo and EGNOS) satellite navigation system project , like the Schengen Information System II project , has turned into a bottomless money pit . 
The follow-up costs still seem impossible to estimate in concrete terms; all that is clear is that savings are necessary if we are to prevent a final explosion in the already mushrooming project costs . 
However , problems arise here when the associated cuts in services only affect the citizens of Europe as taxpayers , only leaving services for military use untouched . 
Further discussions relating to the previous procedure and implementation and its future administration , use and funding are required in this context . 
It certainly seems unlikely that an increased use of private enterprise in this area will bring any financial relief . 
The Commission ' s evaluation is certainly awaited with anticipation . 
The Galileo idea is a good one in principle; however , the costs must be brought under control . 
I took this into consideration when voting . 
Once again (as in the case of the ITER project) , the EU has managed to delay a project for so long that the costs are impossible to estimate . 
This is equally true for the follow-up costs for the GNSS (Galileo and EGNOS satellite navigation systems) and Schengen Information System II projects . 
It is not just follow-up costs that have exploded: ' normal ' project costs have also reached massive proportions . 
An attempt is now being made to limit damage by making savings . 
These are necessary moves . 
Unfortunately , it seems as if these cuts will only affect the European taxpayer as they will result in reductions in services . 
Although GNSS will only have a military application , it will be the taxpayers who foot the bill - twice over now as a result of the follow-up costs . 
This situation casts a pall over the GNSS project , which is otherwise something to be welcomed . 
For that reason , I have abstained from voting . 
I voted in favour of the report on the mid-term review of the Galileo programme . 
The ambitious European endeavour to develop a European satellite navigation system , based on a constellation of 30 satellites and offering quality global positioning services , guarantees Europe ' s autonomy and independence from other global navigation systems and a share in the important global high-tech market , on which the USA and Japan are currently top of the league . 
Moreover , Galileo will have the facility to support the implementation of previous traffic management systems for all means of transport (road , air , sea , etc . ) , which will improve efficiency and reduce the environmental impact . 
In the agricultural sector , Galileo will be able to support improvements to agricultural output by guaranteeing more efficient use of land and water , thereby reducing the need for fertilisers and pesticides . 
However , the questions raised and my previous question to the Commission about the very high cost of this particular endeavour have remained unanswered . 
To be precise , the cost of implementing the programme was initially estimated at EUR 3 330 million (of which 1 800 million was to be paid by the public sector) . 
This was increased to EUR 5 580 million , all of which is to be paid by the public sector at a very difficult time for the economy . 
I voted in favour of this report . 
The EU has taken an important step with the adoption of its policy decision , recorded in Regulation (EC) No 683 / 2008 , on the creation of autonomous European global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) - Galileo and European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) - under the ownership and management of the EU . 
The communication considered in this report constitutes a mid-term review of this emblematic initiative in which there is an assessment of the process and its implementation to date , with a debate launched on its future governance , use and financing . 
In the current economic context , there is a pressing need to conduct a wide-ranging political debate about the desired level of ambition , which will determine the level of service provided , and on the resources available , during which it will be necessary to make a political choice between a model whereby it is exclusively funded by the EU and one whereby national or private contributions may be permitted . 
The result of this debate will be reflected in the political choices regarding future governance and management systems for GNSSs . 
The Galileo system will improve the accuracy and the reliability of US Global Positioning System (GPS) information . 
This new system will be important for ensuring Europe ' s autonomy and independence from other global navigation systems and enabling it to claim a share of this booming worldwide high-tech market . 
As we know , the programme is funded fully by the Union budget with a budget of EUR 3 . 4 billion until 2014 . 
We know that the indirect benefits of the programme are estimated to be around EUR 60 billion per year , but the Commission has admitted that additional investment will be required in order to reach full operational capacity . 
As it is not clear how much the Galileo system will cost the taxpayer , I abstained on this measure , not least to reiterate the request to the Commission to clarify the project ' s future costs . 
The Galileo programme , which , in conjunction with the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) , aims to create a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) , is in line with a strategic choice on the part of the Union: it confirms its entry onto the global market , while its efforts assert itself in the global market , which is currently dominated by the United States , and is important to boosting the European economy itself . 
Let us remember that , as is said in the report , 7% of EU gross domestic product (GDP) depends on the use of the Global Positioning System (GPS) , reinforcing the need for an autonomous satellite navigation system . 
The intention at the moment is to carry out a comprehensive analysis of the project . 
Among the conclusions to draw from it , it should be stressed that the running costs of these programmes are estimated to be some EUR 800 million per annum and that revenue will only reach EUR 80 million per annum by around 2030 . 
Nevertheless , it is estimated , on the other hand , that the indirect benefits could be worth as much as EUR 60 billion per annum . 
In this context , I think it is important , as the rapporteur suggests , to launch the debate about the structure of this programme and how to make money out of it in future , so as to adopt robust and safe solutions for the future of Europe . 
I fully support the autonomous European global navigation satellite system , and I agree with the adoption of all the measures essential to securing its full operational capacity . 
This view prevails across the groups of the European Parliament , as is borne out by the fact that no amendments have been submitted for the report . 
In the report of Mr Remek , we call on the European Commission to move towards a solution to the problems that have arisen and to ensure a funding procedure for the programme such that it can achieve full operational capacity in 2018 . 
In the interests of retaining the EU ' s competitive advantage , the launch must not be delayed , otherwise other countries such as China , India and Japan will outstrip us . 
in writing . - This has been a disastrous vote for the Greens . 
We voted against the two separate votes (paragraphs 19 and 20) , and both were adopted; we voted against at the final vote , but the text was adopted . 
Our concerns are mainly about the speed with which some wish to pursue this , despite the numerous questions we still have . 
I voted for this report because I agree on the importance of the Galileo project , as part of a European global navigation satellite system . 
It will ensure the European Union ' s autonomy and independence from other global navigation systems , and enable it to claim a share of this booming worldwide high-tech market . 
Given that our competitors are getting stronger and advancing dynamically , and that to fully exploit its advantages , Galileo needs to reach full operation capacity , the project would require additional investment , as indicated by the rapporteur . 
in writing . - I welcome this report , which asks for the Commission to launch a comprehensive analysis to obtain a more precise identification of the possible scenarios and means for operation and exploitation after 2013 . 
This includes all commercial aspects of exploitation as well as the legal , contractual and financing structures of the different exploitation models that will ensure that a stable governance model is put into place . 
The report was adopted in committee by an overwhelming majority (44 to 4) . 
The European initiative to create the Galileo and European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) programmes will not only enable Europe to establish autonomy and strategic independence from other economic blocs , but , above all , will also bring improvements to the daily lives of Europeans , and will generate direct and indirect benefits for the European economy . 
However , in order for the programme ' s real benefits to be achieved , there is a need to establish a medium- and long-term strategy for financing and governance , covering the main actions to be carried out . 
That is the only way it will be possible to create the necessary market confidence and , consequently , to secure investment as well as the purchase of applications and services . 
Only if they become fully functional will the Galileo and EGNOS systems provide concrete benefit for all European Union policies , specifically , in transport , in agriculture , in the fight against climate change , in the prevention of natural and human disasters , and in the area of science , technology and innovation . 
To increase support for these projects , it is crucial to increase communication between those in charge of them and the general public , in order to create a direct relationship between these initiatives and European citizens . 
Further to that , I believe it is necessary to create an appropriate financial structure so it can be realised and then applied . 
in writing . - This report looks at the progress that has been made towards a European global satellite navigation system , or Galileo , and looks at issues regarding the future governance of the initiative . 
When fully operational , Galileo will be a rival to American GPS , and will operate on a wider and more accurate system of satellites and ground stations across the world . 
Although there has been substantial technical progress , the report is more critical of the financial situation regarding the project . 
It raises issues that need to be addressed and recommends courses of action that can ensure that the satellite system reaches Full Operational Capacity (FOC) as soon as possible , meaning a quicker return on the investment , and this report serves as the basis for the debate on how the Commission can best achieve this . 
I am voting for this report in that it presents suitable political priorities for Parliament for the Multiannual Financial Framework , in both legislative and budgetary terms . 
Some priorities included by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament which I would highlight are , for example: 1) investment for jobs and growth; 2) the social aspect , and the workers ' rights and conditions; 3) sustainability; 4) European added value; 5) proposed structure and duration . 
I note the need to pay particular attention to the outermost regions , to regions with serious and permanent natural or demographic limitations , such as the most northerly regions with very low population density and islands , and to cross-border and mountain regions; this is because the resources and capabilities of these regions can play a significant role in the future competitiveness of the European Union . 
in writing . - I voted against the Garriga Polledo report from the SURE committee because it wants to increase the EU budget for the period 2014-2020 by 5% . 
I could not vote in favour of the Conservative Party amendment to freeze the budget at 2013 levels because I firmly believe it is a reduction that is needed , and their stand represents a weak starting point for negotiations . 
I introduced an amendment to reduce the budget by 2 . 8% , which is the average rate of irregularities affecting the EU budget as reported by the European Court of Auditors . 
Among the amendments and innovations I opposed was an amendment to create an informal and powerless monitoring group in the European Parliament to scrutinise programmes . 
in writing . - I voted in favour of this important resolution on Investing in the future: a new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for a competitive , sustainable and inclusive Europe . 
I support the rapporteur that with the rejection of the option of freezing the resources , as proposed by five Heads of Government in December 2010 (France , United Kingdom , the Netherlands , Germany and Finland) , the European Parliament is sending a strong political signal for the negotiations between the 27 Member States , due to start after the official presentation of the European Commission proposal expected on 29 June . 
It is important to note that unanimity between the Member States and the assent of the European Parliament are needed to take the final decision , not expected until at least June 2012 . 
We , Members of the European Parliament , demand at least an increase of the level of resources of 5% compared to the 2013 budget . 
It is also important to note that the European Parliament proposes to introduce a new structure for the financial framework under a single ' Europe 2020 ' heading and asks for a 5 , or 5 + 5 year-long framework as of 2021 . 
After around a year ' s work , the special committee on policy challenges and budgetary resources has finally presented the future decisions determining priorities in expenditure for the efficient and effective use of European Union appropriations leading to the implementation of result-oriented policies . 
Bearing in mind that the European Union budget is primarily an investment budget , which can generate more investment from public or private sources , it must be possible to adjust it adequately to changing needs and circumstances . 
The decision to increase the resources of the new Multiannual Financial Framework by 5% will guarantee the stability of existing programming cycles and new investment in areas such as European energy and transport networks , which will allow Europe to defend its competitiveness and prepare the ground for long-term economic growth . 
These sectors also appear in the Europe 2020 strategy , which aims to deliver smart , sustainable and inclusive growth through knowledge , innovation and the promotion of social and territorial cohesion . 
in writing . - The report on a New Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for a competitive , sustainable and inclusive Europe is a valuable piece of collective analysis on the future configurations of the EU budget . 
It estimates the financial resources needed for the Union to attain its objectives and carry out its policies for the period starting 1 January 2014 . 
Its essential point is a request for an increase of at least 5% in the total EU budget for 2013 , and the request for the introduction of an autonomous source of funding . 
The report stresses very clearly that without sufficient additional resources in the post-2013 MFF , the Union will not be able to fulfil the existing policy priorities , linked , in particular , to the Europe 2020 strategy , or the new tasks provided for by the Treaty of Lisbon , let alone respond to unforeseen events . 
I voted in favour of this report also because it calls for a more transparent , simpler and fairer financing system for the European Union . 
I voted in favour of this excellent report by my colleague , Mr Garriga Polledo , as it provides an extremely good presentation of the budget that the European Union will need after 2013 to respond to the political challenges it will face . 
If Europe really intends to implement the policies laid down in the European Treaties , including the most recent policies , it must have the financial resources it needs to fulfil these ambitions . 
Therefore , I voted for the collection of ' own resources ' and the creation of a ' tax on financial transactions ' to fund the European Union ' s budget . 
This necessary increase in the European budget must be accompanied by substantial savings through optimising (pooled) expenditure . 
Furthermore , the common agricultural policy (CAP) , which is essential for the food security and independence of our continent , and EU regional policy , strengthened by creating an intermediate category of regions to enable additional financial support to be channelled to those regions where per capita GDP is between 75% and 90% of the European average , such as Auvergne and Limousin , find within it all the space that they deserve . 
This report is therefore of inestimable support to citizens ! 
The European farming sector is of socio-economic importance , particularly in terms of ensuring the security of food supply and in terms of promoting rural communities and the environment . 
So , the CAP must have a strong budget and proper resources so as to be able to meet those goals . 
I fully support what is in the report on the broad aims and tasks of the CAP and that there be no cuts in CAP funding for 2013 , so that it would be able to properly meet those broad needs . 
Much is expected of the next Multiannual Financial Framework in terms of achieving the aims of the Europe 2020 strategy , encouraging research and innovation , combating the challenges facing the environment , achieving the aims of the European Social , Cohesion and Regional Funds , and fostering education , mobility , training and lifelong learning . 
The EU must have adequate resources and a strong Multiannual Financial Framework if it is to achieve those goals and meet the needs of the people of the Union . 
I voted in favour of this report . 
The European Union faces enormous challenges , and will require significant financial resources to overcome these . 
It is clear that the EU budget ' s current resource system will be incapable of ensuring the implementation of all the commitments made . 
I agree that it is necessary to fundamentally review budgeting principles , so that , in future , funds for the EU budget are collected from own resources . 
We also urgently need to consider innovative financing mechanisms , such as a tax on financial transactions , which would make a significant contribution to financing the EU budget . 
I cannot support the report by Mr Garriga Polledo . 
The reason for this is that I am fundamentally against Member States ' contributions being replaced with direct EU funding , for which read an EU tax . 
After all , the Union should be at the service of Member States and that must be visible in the financing arrangements . 
In terms of content , I have problems with the EU 2020 strategy being used as a guideline for the Multiannual Financial Framework . 
The objectives of the strategy concern social and employment policies , which fall within the competence of individual Member States . 
The failed Lisbon strategy shows where we will end up if we base our strategy on matters over which the EU has no say . 
The report also seeks to reduce the amount of arrears by increasing payments . 
If projects are not being implemented smoothly , then the sensible thing to do would be to enter into fewer new contractual commitments . 
In brief , the report shows no trace of understanding of prudent budgetary management , in light of the enormous economic problems facing European economies . 
 ' Cut your coat according to your cloth ' is a better suggestion than this undesirable call for more and new resources . 
In this way , we are repeating , at a European level , the mistakes which several countries have made in recent years . 
The Polledo report focuses attention on the numerous challenges faced by the European Union , but mainly on the need for ordinary citizens to be convinced that European institutions and the European Union are serving their values and interests . 
This is why I support the forthcoming Multiannual Financial Framework , which will help convince European citizens that the Union has the ability to think and act to protect their long-term interests and achieve effective results in ensuring stable growth and internal cohesion . 
Although there are a few decisions which I do not fully agree with , the report is , on the whole , beneficial to Bulgaria ' s interests , and I voted to adopt it . 
I voted against Mr Garriga Polledo ' s report because of some points that I feel are critical in the motion put to the vote . 
Although I support some paragraphs , such as the one regarding the reduction of the European Parliament to one seat , the report hopes that an actual European tax will be introduced to finance European Union activities . 
It discusses funding for Roma communities , a subject that my political party has always opposed , and the allocation of large amounts of funding for a new round of enlargement of the European Union in the direction of the Western Balkans , another point with which I do not agree . 
Finally , European funding has been pledged to help developing countries combat climate change , an issue which , aside from environmental propaganda , will certainly not change the future of the ecosystem . 
I voted in favour of this resolution because I feel that the European Parliament ' s contribution to the debate on how money from the EU budget should be distributed in future (2014-2020) , and which areas should be financed to help Europe recover following the global crisis , is particularly important . 
Following the debate , the resolution adopted criticised the idea put forward by certain Member States of freezing the EU budget at 2013 levels , given the financial difficulties that many EU countries have faced in recent times . 
Instead , when determining the EU financial perspective 2014-2020 , we were urged to continue to guarantee the required financing for areas that stimulate economic growth and successful development . 
These areas include research and fostering innovation , combating unemployment , poverty and exclusion , adequate preparedness for demographic changes , responsible use of natural resources , internal and external security , regional and agricultural policy , and development of energy and transport infrastructure . 
I congratulate the rapporteur on his work , which I endorsed . 
Europe must use the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) to provide definite answers to the citizens , who have been suffering from the economic crisis for too long now , and to ensure robust long-term growth . 
So far , the European Union has fallen short of the expectations and ambitions it should have . 
We will have to face very complex challenges as well as the economic crisis , demographic decline and energy shortages . 
The response to these challenges will have to be sought in the Europe 2020 strategy , which should be the policy reference of the next MFF . 
We must identify a number of key priorities for the next MFF , such as growth and employment , sustainable development , cohesion for growth and employment , citizenship and Global Europe . 
The next MFF must therefore be designed in such a way as to ensure flexibility in order to avoid the shortcomings of the current MFF . 
In fact , it would be a good idea to plan a mid-term review to allow for the possibility of revising the ceilings . 
Finally , it is crucial to enhance the current system of extra-budgetary instruments for flexibility , simplifying their use and providing them with sufficient envelopes . 
The next MFF should strike the right balance between stability , medium-term predictability and flexibility , a principle which should remain at its core . 
I voted on Wednesday , 8 June for an increase in the 2014-2020 budget . 
As we know , the budget represents the start of any political act . 
If you have no budget , you have no project . 
The EU budget must therefore reflect the EU ' s growth strategy and its ambitions for its citizens . 
The Member States have suggested freezing the EU budget for two reasons . 
On the one hand , the money comes from contributions by the States and , on the other , a stable budget for the 2014-2020 period means that all the EU ' s major projects to restore growth and to invest in the future are jeopardised . 
Member States would like to see the EU playing a decisive role when it comes to taking risks but they criticise it when it does so . 
I therefore , like the majority of my fellow Members - with the exception of the Eurosceptics - voted for a 5% increase in the budget to fund future major projects . 
We are now well aware of the fact that States are incapable of resolving on their own the problems caused by globalisation . 
The next step will be to provide the EU with a budget based on ' own resources ' in order to curtail our reliance on the ' bad ' will of States . 
The EU ' s powers have increased over the years , especially after the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon . 
However , the budget has grown only very slowly . 
Our ambition is to have a competitive , sustainable and inclusive Europe . 
If we want to achieve this ambitious goal , I believe that the financial resources the EU has need to be just as ambitious . 
This is why I believe that a minimum 5% increase is needed to the budget envisaged for the next MFF . 
The EU also needs to hold an in-depth discussion on the topic of own resources involving both representatives of the European institutions and national parliaments , so as to reach a consensus on an own resources system which will ensure the effective implementation of European policies . 
I support the idea expressed in this report about the need to channel the resources towards those measures aimed at achieving the Europe 2020 strategy objectives . 
I also fully concur with the need to ensure coherence and complementarity between the various instruments which currently exist for supporting research , development and innovation . 
Finally , a credible budget must be coherent and guarantee efficient expenditure by avoiding any duplication in the use of funds . 
I voted in favour of this report . 
The great virtue of this report is to seek to mobilise all the EU ' s budgetary resources in a coherent fashion and as a means to achieve the Europe 2020 strategy , and to take a stand that is diametrically opposed to the narrow approach of most Member States . 
While these Members bring Europe down to the common denominator of their contributions , which they would like to see fall , and of its financial returns , which they would like to see increase , this report argues for strong , integrated community policies , both in terms of long-standing policies and in terms of the new competences entrusted under the Treaty of Lisbon . 
in writing . - We need to gear the EU budget for the 21st century . 
The budget must match our ambitions . 
New pan-European investments are needed to boost European-level added value by acting as a catalyst for further private investment and by creating economies of scale . 
Major green investment is needed in areas like renewable infrastructure , with more wind farms in the north and solar energy in the south . 
Irish investment in wind energy will only pay off , for example , if there is European infrastructure to export that energy via the UK and France . 
With oil prices rising and increasing environmental damage , we know the EU must now drive forward to a more sustainable society by becoming more energy efficient , by using more renewable energy , by investing in public transport and ensuring our children live in a clean and healthy environment . 
The long term EU budget should also follow the agreed so-called EU 2020 strategic objectives , especially our internationally binding climate objectives . 
CAP should be reformed to pay farmers for the delivery of public goods , such as an attractive countryside rich in biodiversity . 
We need to maintain the CAP budget to ensure these vital environmental services are provided in Ireland and across Europe . 
in writing . - (NL) The report on the EU ' s Multiannual Financial Framework does not in any way take into account the frustrations of the Member States and of the voters and taxpayers throughout Europe . 
We keep hearing calls for more revenue for the European Union , at the same time as all other levels of administration are having to make cuts . 
Our failure not to take this into account bears witness to our profound arrogance and alienation from the world . 
Europe must cut its coat according to its cloth , confine itself to its core activities and must itself make a number of savings . 
Only in this way will we be able to restore confidence amongst the voters . 
I voted for the report on the new Multiannual Financial Framework because it introduces the option of applying a financial transaction tax at European level . 
This would levy a tax on speculative financial transactions to discourage this kind of practice and would help generate new incomes intended for European Union Member States . 
The European Union , through its funding for research and innovation , and through its support to agriculture but also to regional development , contributes in a very tangible manner to boosting the European economies . 
For this reason , I fully support the proposals adopted today by our Parliament to set the European Union ' s budget for the next seven years . 
In order to meet citizens ' needs , Parliament has proposed to create , in the context of the Structural Funds , a new category of regions where GDP per capita is between 75% and 90% of the Union ' s GDP . 
These regions will thus receive financial aid according to criteria more suited to their situation . 
I fully support this proposal , which will , for instance , benefit directly people living in my constituency in Languedoc-Roussillon . 
The European Parliament has spoken out again on the European budget through the Multiannual Financial Framework , a kind of EU five-year plan . 
Now the EU , which requires what can be very demanding sacrifices of Member States , in no way provides for the application of this good advice to itself . 
The proposals contained in this text are unrealistic and are nearer to mind-numbing mantras; waste and bureaucracy still have a bright future ahead of them . 
Worse still , in order to escape ' blackmail ' by Member States , which are naturally reluctant to increase their already very high contributions , Parliament once more raises the issue of own resources for the EU , or , in short , a European tax . 
 ' Do as I say and not as I do ' could be the new European motto . 
By adopting this report , I welcome the fact that Amendment 74 was preserved , since it advocates the creation of a category of regions referred to as ' intermediate ' for the next programming period 2007-2013 of the cohesion policy and is therefore along the lines of fairer distribution of structural and cohesion funds between regions . 
I have a positive view of the report ' s focus on the common challenges that Europe is facing . 
It addresses the issues of the climate and the environment as constituting an element of all policy areas , the fight for democracy , peace and freedom at a global level , and the urgent need for research , innovation and infrastructure . 
The Europe 2020 strategy and investment in initiatives with European added value permeated the debates during the work on the report . 
However , I am deeply concerned about the fact that we have given the authority to set priorities to the Council . 
The European Parliament should have had the courage to set priorities . 
Even though all of the requirements for an inclusive , sustainable and competitive Europe are included , there is nevertheless no way in the world that we could finance everything all at once from the EU budget . 
I want a realistic and implementable negotiating strategy and this has not been achieved , as no clear priorities have been set in this report . 
I therefore abstained in the final vote . 
At a time when the EU has already understood that greater coordination of economic policy and greater control of budgetary policy are both necessary , the idea that the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) should support economic governance seems an extremely relevant one to me . 
Further to this idea , I find countless concerns in the report that deserve to be worked on and studied . 
I consider placing the MFF at the service of the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy , and the concern for at least maintaining the common agricultural policy (CAP) budget and keeping the two-pillar system , to be positive . 
However , I would state , once again , that the call for the introduction of a financial transaction tax has once again appeared in a report which is not directly related to setting out financial policy , and which I do not consider transparent practice . 
I would congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work , which has resulted in a report enabling us to start drawing up the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for the post-2013 period , which constitutes a challenge for the Commission and for the Council . 
The Europe 2020 strategy is consensual , its priorities are clear and its objectives are measurable . 
It will be the guide for the forthcoming financial perspectives . 
However , the strategy will only be successful if it has budgets corresponding to its actions and objectives . 
In this sense , it is necessary for the MFF ' s values to match the ambition and commitment that the Europe 2020 strategy constitutes . 
Cohesion policy is a result of the solidarity principle . 
It is important that this cohesion be economic , social and territorial , and that it support the poorest regions . 
I consider it essential that funding for cohesion policy be at least maintained at the same levels . 
The common agricultural policy (CAP) has been a success . 
Therefore , the total sums channelled into agriculture should also be kept up and should be distributed more equitably . 
It is important that we move towards an MFF whose revenues are not more than 80% dependent on national budgets . 
There is , therefore , a pressing need to go ahead with the debate on the new own resources . 
The rapporteur has stated that the time has come to put a stop to loudly proclaimed statements of intent that are not properly backed up with the financial resources enabling the announced objectives to be actually achieved . 
This report is a perfect example of this exercise . 
By basically proposing that the EU budget be frozen until the 2020 review , with a residual increase of 5% , many of the objectives that feature in the course of its 40 pages are being compromised , particularly , that of social and economic cohesion . 
In the face of a serious economic and social crisis , exacerbated by EU policy , the budgets made possible by these financial perspectives will thus be rendered incapable of ensuring a redistributive function , which is essential to the effective realisation of the principle of cohesion . 
We have made countless proposals on the need to increase the EU budget to support economic and social cohesion , as well as to reduce the compulsory nature of national contributions , cutting them to a maximum of 10% of the total cost for the project submitted , particularly in the countries with the greatest financial difficulties . 
Furthermore , we have been stressing the importance of promoting investment in public services , of supporting production , of creating jobs with rights , of eradicating poverty , and of combating social inequality . 
The path proposed in this report is something else; something very different . 
That is why we voted against it . 
In spite of the occasional positive point , the report does not recommend a break with and a change from the European Union ' s policies on its financial resources . 
We therefore voted against . 
It is especially serious that it does not tackle , as an absolute priority , the response to the serious social problems created by the economic and social crisis , with a significant increase in the EU budget for supporting economic and social cohesion , accompanied by a cut in compulsory national contributions , reducing them to a maximum of 10% of the project submitted . 
Above all , in the countries with the greatest financial difficulties , it should commit to investment in public services , to supporting production , to creating jobs with rights , to eradicating poverty , and to combating social inequality and all types of discrimination , not least gender . 
It is also necessary to promote peace , development cooperation and aid , and a significant cut in military spending and overseas representation . 
Lamentably , the report limits itself to proposing a residual increase in current EU budget values of 5% , despite opposing the freezing of the post-2013 EU budget , as advocated by some Member States . 
However , this suggested increase means that the next Multiannual Financial Framework (financial perspectives) 2014-2020 would represent just 1 . 11% of EU gross national income (GNI) , as opposed to 1 . 06% , the sum projected for 2013 . 
In a situation where many Member States are implementing tough fiscal measures , the EU budget needs to be better justified than ever before . 
It must ensure the highest possible level of European added value , it must be sensibly managed and it must support public and private resources as far as possible . 
The structure of the future Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) should be realistic , and it should enable continuity of planning and avoid the shortcomings of the current MFF , especially the lack of flexibility within the areas . 
With regard to the method for developing a system of own resources for the EU , which is gradually being replaced by Member State contributions and is consequently perceived as an excessive burden on the public finances of Member States , the reform of this system is more necessary than at any time in the past . 
In my opinion , a better system ensuring fairness , transparency and sufficient budgetary revenues would make it possible for the budgetary decision-making process to focus more on the key priorities of the Union . 
In particular , the current exemptions and corrective mechanisms should be gradually phased out , which would be an essential step towards greater fairness and transparency in the EU budget . 
in writing . - The EU budget post-2013 must be fit for purpose to maintain competitiveness , to increase economic growth and to combat high unemployment in Europe . 
I believe that agriculture and a strong , well resourced common agricultural policy are central to this objective . 
I fully support the call in the report to link agriculture to the Europe 2020 strategy as I firmly believe that the agriculture and food sector can make a valuable contribution to future economic growth in Ireland and across Europe . 
That is why it is essential that we protect and maintain the some EUR 1 . 7 billion which Ireland annually receives under the CAP . 
A strongly funded common agricultural policy will protect Europe ' s food security , contribute to our climate change targets and maintain employment in our rural communities . 
I am pleased that the report recognises the role played by the fisheries and aquaculture sectors in maintaining employment in coastal , island and remote regions . 
I believe that we must direct more funding to these communities under the European Fisheries Fund post-2013 . 
The peace process in Ireland has benefited hugely from the EU budget . 
I urge all Members to support the retention of these important programmes . 
To be brief , notwithstanding the exceptional length of the text , Parliament calls for the European budget , in its total amount and distribution , to be adapted after 2013 to the competences and very large number of priorities of the European Union , as it defines them . 
It therefore demands for it to be increased - by at least 5% in the first instance . 
How is it to be financed ? 
By a new European tax , of course ! 
Who are they trying to kid ? 
Europe already costs a great deal . 
What has been the result ? 
Powerlessness in the face of the crisis , harm caused by the euro , the trade agreements and the Schengen Agreement , useless posturing , interferences and obstacles in other domains . 
At a time when Member States are being asked to slash their own budgets drastically , when people are being summoned to tighten their belts , when social security systems are being undermined by unemployment and immigration , while those responsible for the crisis continue to line their pockets and markets continue to speculate , it is obscene for this assembly , in cahoots with Brussels , to demand a single cent more to pursue these policies and make them worse . 
With the adoption of the Garriga report on the political and budgetary challenges facing the European Union after 2013 , Parliament is anticipating , much too timidly in my view , the debate to come on the future financial prospects of the Union . 
This report reiterates its opposition to pitting against each other the different policies that fall within EU competence and insists on the need to mobilise sufficient funds , consistent with the EU 2020 strategy . 
It sends a clear message to Member States: we intend to support strong integrated policies and to do this by increasing the budget by at least 5% . 
Furthermore , in a context where citizens are subjected to austerity , we must maintain a strong cohesion policy . 
That is what we propose in this report , with support for the plan to create an intermediate category of regions , which will enable a distribution of Structural Funds that is more in accordance with the real economic and social situations of our territories . 
Finally , the Union must grant itself financial resources that match its ambitions . 
We have therefore reiterated our desire to introduce a tax on financial transactions , a project which is widely supported by the public and which would encourage greater support on their part for the European project . 
By voting for the Garriga Polledo report , the European Parliament has made its voice heard on the future of the European budget and put forward an ambitious proposal for the next Multiannual Financial Framework . 
The request to increase the post-2013 EU budget by 5% , and therefore to increase the total European Union GNI from 1 . 06% to 1 . 11% , corresponds to a desire to honour commitments made to support growth and development , first and foremost , the Europe 2020 strategy , for which adequate resources are needed . 
It is important , in fact , to remember the added value of the European budget , which can act as a driver for economic growth , research and development and employment , particularly for young people , alongside national budgets . 
The report also reinforces Parliament ' s position in favour of new financial instruments , such as the tax on financial transactions and Eurobonds , which are an opportunity for the European economy . 
It is now down to the Commission to take up Parliament ' s ambition , presenting its proposals for the next European financial framework and not falling victim to the restrictive budget policies of Member States . 
I voted in favour of this report insofar as it launches an appeal to set up strong , integrated EU policies . 
Two other important points received my support . 
Firstly , the creation of a category of ' intermediate regions ' within cohesion policy in order to ensure that the distribution of Structural Funds matches more closely the real economic and social situation of the territories; and secondly , a renewed call for the creation of a tax on financial transactions as a new resource to safeguard European economic policies . 
At a time of austerity policies and when unbounded financial speculation persists , it is fair to require the financial sector to play its part in relaunching an economy that has been battered by its irresponsible behaviour . 
The resolution adopted by the European Parliament is our first contribution to the debate on the future financial perspective . 
I wholeheartedly support the proposal to increase the European Union ' s budget in the upcoming budgetary perspective . 
I believe that the European Union needs an ambitious budget , which will correspond to the challenges facing us . 
Reducing or freezing the European budget , as proposed by some of the Member States , is not a good solution for the European economy . 
The European budget must be a budget which will support the Member States as they exit the crisis , and which is also able to respond to unexpected events more flexibly . 
I also welcome Parliament ' s support for the idea of categorising some areas as intermediate regions , in order to ensure that their further development is promoted despite the fact that they exceed the currently binding criterion of 75% of the European Union ' s GDP . 
Introducing this category will help regions which are still contending with many development challenges even though they have exceeded the EU average and , in the near future , this will include Polish regions . 
I believe that the EU budget must be given sufficient resources to be able to finance the commitments that have been decided upon . 
At the same time , I would like to emphasise that the EU ought to have an attitude of restraint and provide these resources by means of redistribution within the existing EU budget . 
I do not believe that the overall size of the budget should increase . 
I would prefer to see the agricultural budget reduced in favour of the priorities of research and development and the conversion to green energy , etc . set in the Europe 2020 strategy . 
Therefore , I also do not believe that the 2013 budget level for agriculture should be retained , but would welcome the distribution of agricultural aid evenly between the Member States . 
I also believe that it is very important to improve the efficiency of the EU ' s administrative expenditure , and one way of doing this is to increase the transparency of the process for distributing and using this expenditure . 
I do not believe that the own resources ceiling should be revised , as it should be possible to finance EU policy within the current income ceiling . 
I also see a need for a review of the EU ' s own resources system . 
The current system is very complicated and lacks transparency . 
The rebates have not made the system any fairer , but instead have given rise to a number of new exemptions and corrections . 
However , a change in this system does not give the EU a direct right of taxation , as the Treaty does not provide for any such competence for the Union . 
Any change to the own resources system also requires all Member States to give their approval in order for it to enter into force . 
In the vote on the report on the EU ' s long-term budget in Strasbourg on 8 June 2011 , we Swedish Conservatives in the European Parliament chose to vote against the proposal . 
This was because the proposal does not set priorities for important and less important expenditure , which we consider to be necessary . 
Instead of showing leadership and focusing on what will bring growth and competitiveness to Europe , the proposal calls for an increase in the budget of 5% so as to avoid the need to prioritise . 
At a time when the EU Member States are fighting massive budget deficits and growing national debt , the European Parliament is choosing to demand more money for the EU . 
This is a line that we cannot support . 
We should instead phase out the subsidies for the common agricultural policy (CAP) and the Structural Funds , but unfortunately , the proposal that was voted through goes in the opposite direction . 
While we voted against the report as a whole , we welcome the wording in the proposal concerning a ' significant increase ' in appropriations for science and research . 
This is something that we have worked hard for and its inclusion is a step in the right direction . 
When determining the EU financial perspective 2014-2020 , it is necessary to ensure adequate financing for areas that stimulate economic growth and successful development; in other words , to focus on research and fostering innovations , combating unemployment , poverty and exclusion , adequate preparedness for demographic changes , responsible use of natural resources , internal and external security , regional and agricultural policy , and the development of energy and transport infrastructure . 
I abstained from voting on this document because we need to fundamentally review the common agricultural policy , which must guarantee a fair and uniform system of direct payments , and many other important areas , without which we will be unable to create a competitive and strong Europe . 
This report is perhaps one of the most important of this legislature . 
I had the opportunity to be the rapporteur for the Committee on Culture and Education and I believe that the agreement which has been reached , albeit far from perfect , is probably the best we could achieve in the current economic climate . 
I confidently voted for it and hope that it will send a clear message to the Council , which will take into account the European Parliament ' s position . 
I voted for this resolution because the statement identifies the main problems and priorities for the EU in the new Multiannual Financial Framework . 
I should particularly like to emphasise the call contained in the resolution for the Commission to present proposals for an effective and efficient EU common agricultural policy (CAP) , which would more fairly distribute direct payments between Member States and farmers , and strengthen the link between delivery of public goods to society and support payments to farmers . 
I fully support the call for the funds allocated to the CAP in the budget year 2013 to be maintained at the same level for the next financial programming period also , so that the CAP can fulfil its expanded objectives and tasks . 
The new EU financing system must be more transparent , simpler and fairer . 
That is why I support the proposals for the system of national contributions , which places disproportionate emphasis on net balances between Member States instead of on the principle of European solidarity and the European common interest , to be slowly replaced by the Union ' s own resources , which the Union would collect directly and independently of national budgets . 
Even though the European Parliament ' s report on Investing in the future: a new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for a competitive , sustainable and inclusive Europe contains many ideas that should be supported , I did not support it because I believe that it damages the European Union ' s image in the eyes of its residents . 
The report suggests increasing the tax burden on European citizens , and I cannot agree to that . 
One can agree that Europe must have its own finances and that this can be done by tax collection . 
However , this would require the creation of a federal Europe , which should be done through open debates , and not through the back door using tax policy . 
If we wish to continue in this direction , we must first ensure that Member States agree to renounce their tax revenues for the good of the European Union , and only then would it be possible to create a self-financed common budget . 
To make this type of decision , European politicians must involve society , which has not happened in this case . 
I should like to congratulate Mr Garriga Polledo on the excellent work he has carried out on the important matter of the future financial perspective . 
Mr Garriga Polledo has presented the House with an effective summary encompassing the positions of the various national delegations and the various political groups . 
I strongly support the decision to request an increase in resources for the next Multiannual Financial Framework of at least 5% . 
In addition , I would like to highlight the part of the report regarding the common agricultural policy , in view of my role as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development . 
Therefore , I fully support the decision to at least retain the existing agricultural budget , while recalling that the CAP is the only real European policy that can play an important role in a strategic sector that provides goods for public use and generates real European added value . 
Finally , I would like to highlight the vote on cohesion policy , where a safeguard clause was successfully added in the event that intermediate categories are introduced in order to avoid resources being withdrawn from the regions eligible for funding under the convergence , competitiveness and cooperation objective . 
This means that additional resources will be needed to finance a new objective . 
We believe that the EU budget must be given sufficient resources to be able to finance the commitments that have been decided upon . 
At the same time , we would like to emphasise that the EU ought , as far as possible , to have an attitude of restraint and provide these resources by means of redistribution within the existing EU budget . 
We would prefer to see the agricultural budget reduced in favour of the priorities of research and development and the conversion to green energy , etc . set in the Europe 2020 strategy . 
Therefore , we also do not believe that the 2013 budget level for agriculture should be retained , but would welcome the distribution of agricultural aid evenly between the Member States . 
We also believe that it is very important to improve the efficiency of the EU ' s administrative expenditure , and one way of doing this is to increase the transparency of the process for distributing and using this expenditure . 
We do not believe that the own resources ceiling should be revised as it should be possible to finance EU policy within the current income ceiling . 
We also see a need for a review of the EU ' s own resources system . 
The current system is very complicated and lacks transparency . 
The rebates have not made the system any fairer , but instead have given rise to a number of new exemptions and corrections . 
However , a change in this system does not give the EU a direct right of taxation , as the Treaty does not provide for any such competence for the Union . 
Any change to the own resources system also requires all Member States to give their approval in order for it to enter into force . 
This motion for a European Parliament resolution on Investing in the future: a new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for a competitive , sustainable and inclusive Europe is important both in terms of achieving the EU 2020 objectives (with regard to restoring and providing long-term protection for the levels of economic growth) and of preventing a recurrence of the current economic crisis . 
This report states that the Europe 2020 strategy should define the policies of the new MFF as the (EU 2020) objectives can only be achieved through optimum use of existing resources (established through the relevant policies) . 
Therefore , the process of setting the key priorities for the future MFF , such as knowledge for economic growth , cohesion for economic growth and employment , management of natural resources and sustainable development , citizenship and Global Europe , will help ensure the appropriate allocation and optimum use of existing funds . 
Drawing up a new MFF as set out in this report will help devise a long-term action plan which will produce definite results and offer the potential to ensure economic growth for the EU . 
I supported Mr Garriga Polledo ' s report because I found its general outlines justified in the light of the challenges that the European Union is to face over the coming years . 
It is unrealistic to transfer new responsibilities to Europe without increasing the financial resources on which it can draw . 
I would , however , have liked the European Parliament to move beyond the stage of legitimate demands and set a certain number of priorities . 
The ' ever more ' refrain of a number of my fellow Members is too glib a response . 
What we need is to be convincing about the effectiveness of European expenditure compared with national expenditure . 
Furthermore , the qualitative dimension of expenditure is at least as important as the quantitative one . 
Finally , the transfer of funds unspent at European Union level to the EU budget rather than returning them to the Member States represents a source of considerable ' savings ' . 
As for introducing a system of own resources , I remain extremely hesitant about the unilateral introduction of a tax on financial transactions without a serious impact study . 
Support for a measure of this nature without being aware of its implications shows that the majority of the European Parliament is on the wrong track . 
in writing . - I voted with a heavy heart against this resolution . 
While believing that good value can be obtained when 27 Member States pool their resources , I could not vote for a 5% increase in the EU budget beyond 2013 when we have not thoroughly examined existing expenditure with a view to eliminating waste and duplication . 
The EU budget beyond 2013 must prioritise growth and job creation . 
The European Union budget should provide the highest degree of European added value , be managed soundly , and leverage as many public and private resources as possible . 
In order to respond to the challenges ahead , we support the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy , a strategy that should help Europe recover from the crisis and come out stronger , through job creation and smart , sustainable and inclusive growth . 
It is the policy reference for the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) , which should be as ambitious as possible . 
Against this background , we believe that the key priorities for the next MFF should be grouped around the following themes: knowledge for growth and employment , sustainable development , cohesion for growth and employment , citizenship and Global Europe . 
The structure of the next MFF should be realistic , facilitate planning continuity and avoid the shortcomings of the current MFF . 
It should especially strike the correct balance between stability , medium-term predictability and flexibility . 
Finally , we believe that in order to make the European Union budget more equitable and transparent , the existing exceptions and correction mechanisms should be progressively phased out . 
The Garriga report is a test to see how efficiently EU policies are working for the future programming period . 
The rapporteur presents us with a major challenge . 
This involves satisfying national interests , which are so diverse , while , at the same time , improving European added value , which is reflected in the Multiannual Financial Framework . 
I think that European citizens need to have a better understanding of the cohesion policy ' s objectives . 
A strong Europe , which is a Europe that will cope with the global competitive environment , is achieved by maintaining the cohesion policy as a key element in EU policies , aimed at achieving balanced development in every region . 
I want to insist on maintaining a significant proportion of the future budget outlook for the cohesion policy . 
Narrowing the economic and social disparities within the EU must continue to remain its main priority . 
In order to achieve the proposed results , we must keep the main criteria for allocating funds according to the level of development and the convergence between the EU ' s regions . 
I support this report because I think that supplementing the Multiannual Financial Framework after 2013 is a viable solution , which involves making changes to the current structure . 
In addition to the provision of funding for research and development and energy and transport , we must also consider investments in the areas of cohesion and agriculture . 
Mr Garriga Polledo ' s report ' Investing in the future: a new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for a competitive , sustainable and inclusive Europe ' is a very important step in the institutional and economic reorganisation of the European Union following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon . 
We all know that the new Treaty calls for new fields of competence to be reflected in the next MFF . 
This will certainly help us face the new global challenges . 
I voted in favour . 
in writing . - Labour Euro MPs believe the focus and priority for EU spending must be the funding of economic investment and research which boosts the economy and creates jobs . 
Targeted EU spending is one way in which we can boost local economies and bring jobs to our communities . 
In the face of government cuts , the EU is providing vital funds for the UK regions . 
However , taxpayers want to see better value for money . 
That is why Labour Euro MPs voted against calls for a 5% budget increase . 
Savings can and must be made in other areas , in particular , the common agricultural policy , including harmful agricultural export subsidies and tobacco subsidies , in order to fund Europe ' s economic priorities . 
The debate on the next Multiannual Financial Framework is an opportunity for fundamental reform and it must be seized . 
A ' business as usual ' policy is not an option in a Europe that needs finance for jobs and growth . 
Labour Euro MPs do not believe that families should continue to bear the full cost of the UK ' s budgetary contribution . 
That is why we back a debate on alternative ways to fund the EU , cutting the amount coming from VAT and the national budget through options such as coordinated measures addressing the under-taxed financial sector . 
This report makes Europe 2020 the very framework of the future European budget . 
It endorses the European semester , the European stability mechanism and the Euro Plus Pact . 
Not a single word is mentioned in connection with the nuclear issue . 
Should there be a budget for that ? 
I think not . 
At this moment , many Member States are making difficult budgetary adjustments , so defending the EU budget should be very well justified . 
The EU budget should provide the highest level of European added value (EAV) , should demonstrate robust management , and should serve to stimulate public and private resources as much as possible . 
The Europe 2020 strategy is the EU ' s response to such challenges . 
It is a strategy which should help Europe to recover from the crisis and emerge invigorated , through the creation of jobs and smart , sustainable and inclusive growth . 
I agree with the rapporteur when he says that ' the Europe 2020 strategy should be the policy reference of the next [Multiannual Financial Framework] and that it should reflect the ambitions of the strategy ' . 
The priorities for the next MFF should be grouped around the following issues: knowledge for growth and jobs , management of natural resources and sustainable development , cohesion for growth and jobs , citizenship , and Global Europe . 
in writing . - The report by the Special committee on the policy challenges and budgetary resources defines Parliament ' s political priorities for the post-2013 Multiannual Financial Framework . 
An important point in the report is the request for the introduction of one or several genuine own resources to replace the present GNI-based system and to achieve an autonomous , fairer , more transparent , simple and equitable financing system . 
In order to avoid abusive use of accounting figures , it is necessary to support this report . 
I voted in favour . 
Since the fiasco with the euro rescue package , the net contributors have been asked to pay up two and three times over . 
In future years , real hard cash will be poured into these rescue mechanisms instead of guarantees . 
This will have to be financed by the net contributors , in other words , the hard-working citizens of Germany , France , Italy , the Netherlands and Austria , from their national budgets; the first painful cuts are already being felt in these countries . 
Demanding budgetary increases in this difficult situation is scandalous . 
We do not need a bloated EU budget that is perhaps up to ten times higher than necessary; we do not need a budget funded by the EU taxpayer that has lost any sense of the need to economise; we do not need a further bloating of Brussels bureaucracy that robs the shirts from the backs of the net contributors . 
Instead , we should consistently pursue every opportunity to make savings . 
Farming subsidies , the largest and most contentious budgetary factor , should be renationalised . 
This would take the pressure off the EU budget and the Member States will be better able to respond to the specific character of their agricultural sector . 
For this reason , I have no hesitation in voting against the Garriga Polledo report . 
I voted against Amendment 39 in this report and , by extension , for Amendment 62 . 
I think that an intermediary category is needed for regions for the duration of the next programming period , with the only proviso being that the allocation of funds earmarked for these regions does not affect the allocations intended for achieving the convergence and competitiveness objectives . 
Today , during the vote on the Garriga Polledo report on Investing in the future: a new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for a competitive , sustainable and inclusive Europe , I abstained from voting on the amendments tabled by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament , the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance and the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left concerning the forwarding to the European Commission of suggestions regarding the introduction of a tax on financial transactions . 
I could not support this course of action , although I am an ardent supporter of a tax which would provide the EU with its own revenue . 
A European tax will guarantee that the EU ' s goals can be accomplished , without the constraints imposed by the positions of the Member States , which too frequently sacrifice the EU ' s interests to short-term goals . 
However , I believe that it is unwise to propose the introduction of a tax on financial transactions in the European Union alone . 
We are faced with the challenge of making the European economy the most competitive in the world and , in my opinion , it is unacceptable to create a burden which will result in the outflow of capital from Europe . 
Similarly , I believe that attempts to introduce a carbon tax as an alternative to FTT are exceptionally harmful . 
Europe ' s hardworking citizens are being required to pay more and more . 
Following the disastrous euro rescue package , which simply involved the net contributors taking a hit for the mismanagement and corruption in a few southern states , the plan is now to ask the already overburdened citizens of the net contributor countries to cough up even more money . 
Instead of taking every opportunity to save money , expenditure is being further increased . 
We should be aiming to reduce the burden , not increase it . 
I therefore voted against this motion . 
We must establish a Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) that would ensure the transparent and efficient financing of EU policy and would prevent a repetition of the crisis . 
The Europe 2020 strategy should be the implementation reference for the MFF . 
Above all , any new system for financing the budget should not increase the burden on national treasuries or the tax burden for citizens . 
In order to reduce EU citizens ' dissatisfaction with current expenditure , it is necessary to improve the quality of the implementation and application of expenditure . 
We must increase transparency in the allocation and use of funds and reduce administrative costs and bureaucracy . 
Significant attention should be paid to reducing poverty and unemployment , to industry and energy , and the creation of a knowledge-based society . 
We must provide for adequate financing for large-scale research and development projects . 
Given the importance of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) , the appropriate financial resources must be put towards improving their operating conditions . 
I do not agree with the proposal to reduce the financing allocated to the common agricultural policy in the future because agriculture is a particularly sensitive sector . 
Reduced financing will have particularly negative consequences for farmers in all EU countries . 
The European Social Fund should become a political priority in order to achieve social and employment goals . 
We must improve systems for monitoring and evaluating the implementation of cohesion policy . 
As we approach a new stage of EU enlargement , the MFF must provide for properly balanced expenditure . 
I voted for the report by Mr Garriga Polledo because I believe that in the future , financial instruments should be efficient , strengthen cohesion and prepare the European Union for the challenges of the global market . 
I agree with the content of the text , although there are two points that I did not agree with and which I opposed: the tax on financial transactions and the amendments to introduce the ' intermediate category ' . 
I do not believe that a reference to the tax on financial transactions should be included in this report . 
A debate about this tax is important , but it requires in-depth analysis . 
The addition of an intermediate category , on the other hand , would compromise the horizontal approach for Objective 2 regions , which has proven to be effective in recent years , the phasing-out system and funds for Objective 1 regions . 
This would hurt Italian regions to the benefit of regions in the new Member States which , with the recent enlargement , have already received a huge share of funding . 
The new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) is crucial in order for the Europe 2020 strategy to be properly realised and , in general terms , to be able to provide the conditions for robust development which can respond both to the problems that Europe ' s various peoples are experiencing and to their expectations of improvement in their lives . 
In this context , I commend the author of the report for the proposal of a seven-year MFF , in line with the Europe 2020 strategy , subject to mid-term review , advocating , as a minimum: the maintaining of the EU budget , with particular emphasis on the common agricultural policy (CAP) and on cohesion policy; a greater sense of flexibility , which becomes more necessary as the financial constraints become more tangible; and also greater democratic responsibility , so that European funds can genuinely promote development projects that are capable of being sustainable . 
In this context , it is important that regions that have already emerged from Objective 1 are able to move to an intermediate stage , reinforcing the development which they have already proven themselves capable of , instead of them being abruptly abandoned , jeopardising the progress that has been achieved in the meantime . 
We have a positive view of the report ' s focus on the common challenges that we are facing: climate and environmental issues , the fight for democracy , peace and freedom at a global level and the urgent need for research , innovation and infrastructure . 
The Europe 2020 strategy and investment in initiatives with European added value permeated the debates during the work on the report . 
However , we are deeply concerned about the fact that we have passed the authority to set priorities over to the Council . 
This is very unfortunate for the European Parliament . 
Even though all of the requirements for an inclusive , sustainable and competitive Europe are included , it is impossible to finance everything all at once from the EU budget . 
We want a realistic and practicable negotiating strategy , but as no clear priorities have been set in this report , we feel that this goal has not been fulfilled . 
Our proposals to modernise the agricultural budget were not included in the final document . 
For these reasons , among others , we abstained in the final vote . 
I voted in favour of the report presented by Mr Garriga Polledo on behalf of the Special committee on the policy challenges and budgetary resources for a sustainable European Union after 2013 . 
In a context where populism is on the increase , the effectiveness and even relevance of EU policies are regularly brought into question . 
Nonetheless , in the face of current crises , whether financial , economic , social or climatic , we do not need less but rather more Europe . 
This report therefore proposes finally giving the EU the resources to match its ambitions , by arguing for a substantial increase in the EU budget of a minimum of 5% and a mobilisation of the budgetary resources of the Union for the benefit of the EU 2020 strategy . 
Thanks to action by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament , the European Parliament also argues in this report for two strong measures: as far as revenue is concerned , an in-depth reform of the own resources system , in particular , through the creation of a tax on financial transactions (Tobin tax); as far as expenditure is concerned , the creation of a category of ' intermediate regions ' to increase solidarity between the territories of the EU and ensure a fairer distribution of the regional policy ' s Structural Funds . 
The combination of a smaller working population and a higher share of retired people will place additional strains on social welfare systems and economic competitiveness , causing increasingly significant problems in terms of gender poverty , given the high number of elderly women and current disparities in social protection . 
The importance must be emphasised of gender budgeting as a good governance tool to improve efficiency and fairness , proper monitoring of how budgetary allocations affect the economic and social opportunities of men and women , and flexibility to restructure the ones that negatively affect the achievement of gender equality . 
Specific measures to develop the technical and scientific skills of young women need to be included in the European investment plan for employment , environmental protection and innovation , in order to improve their qualifications and employability , in particular , in strategic growth sectors in which they are under-represented . 
The European Social Fund (ESF) should provide adequate resources for measures aimed at improving labour market access and combating unemployment and social exclusion . 
At the same time , I call on the European Commission to propose active measures through the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) in order to support women ' s employment in rural areas . 
in writing . - Renegotiation of the EU budget will impact on how the Union operates in the coming years and on the programmes it can afford . 
The budget as a percentage of the EU Gross National Income should reflect the agreed priorities of the European Union . 
But the negotiations must also reflect Member States ' needs in light of the consolidation efforts under way in many countries , including Ireland . 
The aim to boost employment , productivity and social cohesion in the Europe 2020 growth strategy cannot be discarded because of the current financial problems . 
Productivity-enhancing policies , particularly those in green energy and research and development , must be recognised as the driver of the EU ' s economic future . 
Another issue of major importance , not just to Ireland but to the EU as a whole , is the common agricultural policy . 
It is recognised that significant change is coming after 2013 , but changes to payments under the CAP should gradually evolve to allow farmers to adjust to the new arrangements . 
At the same time , the CAP budget must help European farmers adapt to new challenges and opportunities . 
The EU Multiannual Financial Framework represents an opportunity to make strategic choices for the future . 
In fact , at a time of profound contrition in state action , the increasing of EU budgets represents an act of confidence in the common project and of reinforcement of action undertaken at supranational level . 
In fact , there is a series of challenges facing Member States , whose proper solutions can only be found at EU level . 
in writing . - (FR) To do more with less money , as certain Member States recommend , is mission impossible ! 
That is why the report adopted this afternoon on the new post-2013 Multiannual Financial Framework is important . 
It provides guidelines to enable the European Union truly to enter a period of competitiveness , solidarity and good governance . 
It points out that , in the absence of significant reallocations within the additional resources budget , Europe will never be able to accomplish the new missions assigned to it under the Treaty of Lisbon nor embark on the road towards sustainable growth . 
However , there are very many domains which can contribute to synergies or economies of scale: the European External Action Service , humanitarian aid and civil protection , pooling of resources in defence , research and innovation , major infrastructure projects (especially in the areas of energy and transport) . 
Another idea that has mileage in it is to gradually abandon subsidies that are harmful to the environment , along the lines of what the Commission has done for tobacco . 
I am also pleased that the European Parliament has reaffirmed its support for own resources because it is only right that the Union should manage its own budget . 
I voted against the amendments to Mr Garriga Polledo ' s report calling for intermediate categories of regions , or regions with per capita gross domestic product between 75% and 90% of European Union GDP , to be introduced for the next financial programming period . 
This innovation is apparently one of openness and greater financial flexibility , but in a period of austerity and budget restrictions like the present , it will inevitably lead to cuts in funding for other regions , particularly Objective 1 (convergence) regions , which specifically include the regions of southern Italy . 
I note with regret that my fellow Members failed to pick up on this aspect and have allowed themselves to be influenced by reasoning that goes against the principles of European solidarity . 
Fortunately , Amendment 64 , which was approved , underlines that these transitional measures must not in any case be established at the expense of the current convergence , competitiveness and cooperation (Objectives 1 , 2 and 3) regions . 
The responses we should bring to the challenges that face us - the economic crisis , the rapid rise of the emerging economies , climate change , turbulent demographic change and so on - can only be effective if we create them collectively , at European level . 
I am absolutely convinced that we should move in the direction of greater involvement of the European Union . 
While the EU budget is a major political lever , the ceiling on the EU ' s own resources has remained unchanged since 1993 . 
This resolution calls for the European budget to be allocated resources equal to the EU ' s ambitions . 
I am wholly in favour of this idea and give it my support . 
Personally , I am particularly in favour of implementing the European tax on financial transactions as quickly as possible , if we cannot have an agreement at world level . 
Although I am not entirely in favour of the resources released in this way being allocated to the Union ' s budget , as I think that the Millennium Development Goals should benefit , at least in part , I wished to vote for paragraph 171 to send a positive signal to the Commission and the Council regarding the implementation of this tax . 
in writing . - In favour . 
As my colleague , Bas Eickhout , said before , freezing or decreasing the EU ' s budget post-2013 is not a credible approach if the EU and its Member States are serious about achieving the policy priorities they have set themselves , notably in the Europe 2020 strategy . 
Coordinating EU funding and actions is clearly a better way for us to achieve our common goals , as opposed to individual actions . 
We welcome the fact that MEPs have clearly set out their stall to this end ahead of the forthcoming debate on the future financing of the EU . 
The EU needs a proper and predictable system for financing its own budget in order to end the perpetual , damaging squabbling over national contributions to the EU budget . 
Introducing a true and meaningful ' own-resources ' system for financing the EU budget is the only way to achieve this and we are happy that the EP has thrown its weight behind this long-standing Green priority . 
I believe that with today ' s vote , the European Parliament has sent a strong and clear signal to the Member States asking to freeze the European Union budget for 2014-2020 . 
This substantial reduction in resources is not , in fact , a valid choice for those who believe in a truly competitive Europe , and the countries pursuing it should clearly specify which priority projects will have to be abandoned in order to allow for these cuts . 
The bad habit of making political commitments without having the necessary financial resources must be broken because it undermines the planning and credibility of the whole European system . 
Reducing long-term budgets could compromise both the increase in expenditure on research and innovation and investment in infrastructure , foreign policy and enlargement . 
Furthermore , to reduce them now would have serious consequences for the future of all the Member States . 
Within the framework of voting on ' Investing in the future: a new Multiannual Financial Framework for a competitive , sustainable and inclusive Europe ' , I voted in favour of creating an intermediate category of regions with a per capita GNP between 75% and 90% of the Union ' s GNP . 
Ten French regions should benefit from the creation of this new category , including Nord-Pas-de-Calais and Picardie . 
The creation of this third category of regions will enable them to benefit from funding for employment , sustainable growth and competitiveness . 
Another important point in this report is that it supports the creation of a system of funding the European budget that is transparent , simpler and more equitable . 
Amongst the measures put forward by the Commission , there is the creation of a tax on financial transactions . 
Parliament regularly speaks in favour of this , and I strongly support this measure which will improve how the market operates by reducing speculation , by contributing to financing global public goods and to reducing budget deficits . 
While I would have liked a more ambitious outcome , the Garriga Polledo report on the financial perspective from 2014 is a step forward , the result of a broad political compromise within the Special committee , created for the first time in Parliament , before the Commission presents its proposal . 
The report acknowledges the need for more resources to be put in place to meet the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy , to develop European policies and to meet the commitments arising from enlargement and the Treaty of Lisbon . 
It advocates new own resources , opening the door to a fiscal union and a tax on financial transactions which should be extended to the rest of the world . 
From 2020 , it proposes five-year periods (or five-plus-five-year periods) which are more in tune with the mandate of the institutions . 
I consider the support for activities related to the sea and the creation of a new category for regions that have between 75% and 90% of EU per capita income to be very positive for Galicia . 
This is necessary in order to avoid the flow of EU funds being interrupted and to provide a transition towards improved competitiveness and the promotion of convergence on a sustainable development path . 
When the European Parliament voted on Wednesday 8 June on investing in the future: a new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for a competitive , sustainable and inclusive Europe , I chose to vote against the report . 
At a time when the EU Member States find themselves under serious budgetary pressure , I am disappointed to see that , instead of setting priorities , the European Parliament is choosing to increase the budget by at least 5% . 
The European Parliament voted for contributions to continue in areas that keep the European economy locked in its old ways , by , among other things , setting aside amounts for the common agricultural policy that are at least as large as for the 2013 budget year . 
I am also opposed to the European Parliament ' s proposal to reform the EU ' s financing by introducing an own resources system . 
Some of these resources are intended to come from a financial transaction tax (FTT) . 
in writing . - I will be supporting an amendment in the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) report which limits Member State EU contributions to the rate of inflation (currently 3 . 2%) or below , as suggested by the Heads of State of the UK , France , Germany , Netherlands and Finland . 
The MMF Garriga Report seeks to increase funding from Member States for the period 2014-2020 by 5% , and this I cannot support at a time when extreme adversity is being experienced in the UK from the government ' s dangerous and socially divisive austerity measures . 
I do support many of the measures promoted in the report and in the Green ' s amendments , particularly around the Green New Deal , the end of national rebates and Own Resources for the EU , and am mindful that part of the above-inflation increase is needed to meet obligations under the Lisbon Treaty . 
There are , however , many expensive budget lines remaining in the MFF that shouldn ' t be supported , and I ' m thinking of the EUR 6 . 6 billion to be spent on nuclear fusion as just one example . 
My argument is that if there isn ' t enough funding after inflation-only increases in Member State contributions , ways should be found to re-allocate budget lines to meet any shortfalls . 
Europe 2020 is the European strategy seeking to respond to the new global challenges for the EU and its various Member States , so it is important to structure the economic and financial conditions which will guide its application in the 2014-2021 period . 
This report aims to contribute to setting out the post-2013 Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) , approving a 5% increase in budget appropriations on the current MFF , the maintenance of funding for cohesion and agriculture , and a financial strengthening of the areas of research , development and innovation , and of energy and transport . 
I voted in favour of the report since I view the strategic content as a positive and , overall , since the budget is in line with the objectives enshrined in the Europe 2020 strategy . 
The strengthening of economic governance and the importance of cohesion policy are some of the areas that I would like to emphasise in the pursuit of a smarter , more sustainable and more inclusive Europe . 
I consider it important to create an intermediate category for regions whose per capita gross domestic product (GDP) is between 75% and 90% of EU GDP , thus contributing to increased equality at regional level . 
However , I would like to stress that this new category should not harm the more disadvantaged regions in terms of the allocation of EU funding . 
The MEPs of the Greek Communist Party voted against the report because it expresses in no uncertain terms the strategic policies and economic priorities of monopoly capital , which the EU is being called upon to serve and implement over forthcoming years , on the back of the unfolding capitalist crisis . 
The information from the current financial framework illustrates that , instead of being used to satisfy grassroots needs , the funds available under the euro-unifying budget are being directed against them , in order to support the profitability of the monopoly groups . 
It is a dirty lie that the basic feature of the report is the alleged demand by the European Parliament for spending under the EU budget to be increased by 5% after 2013 . 
Its predominant feature is that it calls not only for this increase , but for all spending under the EU budget to be directed towards promoting the barbaric measures unleashed by capital , the EU and the bourgeois governments against the working classes and grassroots classes in all the Member States . 
It calls for the money of the workers of the Member States which finances the EU budget to be used to promote capitalist restructurings , to sweep away labour rights , to support the profitability of euro-unifying monopolies , to consolidate the mechanisms of the ' memoranda ' and secure lenders in the debtor Member States and to support repressive mechanisms and imperialist interference by the EU . 
Today , I voted in favour of creating ' intermediate regions ' , and I am pleased that this position was adopted by Parliament as a whole . 
This decision will mean that relatively rich areas of poorer Member States (such as Mazovia and Warsaw) will still receive support . 
The position adopted by Parliament today is the first victory in the battle over the shape of the new financial perspective for the period 2014-2020 . 
For Poland , and also for Warsaw , a key factor will be the level of funding and the priorities set out under the cohesion fund . 
The Garriga Polledo report assumes a figure of between 75 and 90% for the intermediate category for regional support . 
This range is unacceptable to me because it offers the prospect of payments to few areas that require support , including in the western part of the EU . 
This goes against the actual aim of regional support , namely the strengthening of the weakest regions . 
The next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) is a perfect opportunity to show European residents that the Union can achieve long-term goals , such as stimulating strong growth and internal cohesion . 
We must not miss such an opportunity . 
I am pleased that the rapporteur stresses the importance of cohesion policy for growth and employment . 
For Lithuanians , it is crucial that the sums earmarked for cohesion policy in the next MFF are not smaller than those in this financial period . 
European cohesion policy continues to play an important role in reducing significant social and economic disparities among the Member States . 
For instance , Lithuania ' s GDP per capita remains low (when we joined the EU , it was 48% of the Union average) . 
However , it is believed that by 2020 , Lithuania ' s GDP will be at least 50% greater than it was without cohesion policy assistance . 
Lithuania ' s goal of improving transport infrastructure and accessibility (23% of the entire allocation of Structural Fund money) , enhancing its R&D capacity (22%) , and supporting business creation , depends on cohesion policy . 
Dwindling cohesion policy funds will continue to crush our economy . 
We must not allow this to happen . 
Trust in the EU will only return when our citizens are convinced that the Union serves their values and interests . 
in writing . - By passing this report on the new Multiannual Financial Framework by 468 to 134 (with 54 abstentions) , the Parliament confirms that it is living in a different world from the harsh economic reality of our times . 
When such tough economic decisions are being made at home , ( . . . ) it is unacceptable for the EU to take no action to cut costs and eliminate waste . ( . . . )
The Parliament decided to ignore the letter of the British Prime Minister , ( . . . ) and the Heads of Government of France , Germany , the Netherlands and Finland , that there must be no increase in the EU Budget ( . . . ) . 
Indeed , many of us want budget cuts and a reduction in Britain ' s excessive contribution . ( . . . ) . 
The British public ( . . . ) will not accept taxes imposed by the EU and nor would the citizens of the other ( . . . ) countries , if they but realised what was going on ( . . . ) . 
Informed economic opinion will tell you that lower taxes are the best incentive to economic growth and job creation . 
This report is intended to provide the financial foundations of the EU superstate which I and my constituents ( . . . ) reject . 
I joined my fellow Conservatives in voting against this report .

Revised Hungarian constitution (debate)
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the revised Hungarian constitution . 
President-in-Office of the Council . - Madam President , Commissioner , honourable Members , the Treaty has not conferred any power on the Council to deal with national constitutions of the Member States . 
Under Article 4(1) and (2) of the Treaty on the European Union , the adoption of a constitution remains in the exclusive competence of the Member State concerned . 
Therefore , the Council has not been in a position to discuss the newly adopted constitution of Hungary . 
Vice-President of the Commission . - Madam President , at President Barroso ' s request , I am addressing the House here today on the subject of the Hungarian constitution . 
At the outset , President Barroso stressed on various occasions that the Commission does not make political judgments on the fundamental constitutional and institutional choices of a Member State . 
The adoption of a new constitution in a Member State is a matter for its people , for its institutions in accordance with the applicable national law and , where relevant , Union and international law . 
The Commission may , however , assess the constitution - as it may any other legal act of a Member State - from the perspective of its compliance with Union law . 
It goes without saying that the constitution of every Member State should reflect and comply with the European values of freedom , democracy , equality , rule of law , human dignity and respect of human rights , including the rights of persons belonging to minorities , without discrimination , as laid down in Article 2 of the Treaty . 
The new Hungarian constitution will enter into force on 1 January 2012 and will require the adoption of implementing measures . 
Therefore , at this stage , the Commission can only make a preliminary analysis , as the precise view on the interaction of the constitution with Union law and its legal effects can only be fully evaluated when taking into account the implementing legislative , administrative and judicial practice based on it . 
The Commission is also following the work of the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe on this matter , and we are expecting a report on 17-18 June . 
I also know that Thomas Markert , the secretary of the Venice Commission , was in the Committee on Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs on 25 May , and I read with great interest the remarks which he made . 
As I have already explained , all the matters discussed at that time are linked to national competence . 
We can become competent only when such matters are translated into legislation . 
I now want to listen to what you parliamentarians have to say in order to understand the position of the European Parliament on this matter . 
Madam President , please do not regard my attitude as impolite but I will address the left of the House: the majority comprising Greens , Communists , Socialists and Liberals , who forced this topic on today ' s agenda in contradiction with the PPE and Conservative groups . 
I have questions for you . 
Do you find it compatible with the prohibition of discrimination based on birth that the European Union has Member States , such as Spain , Belgium or Sweden , where citizens are entitled to hold high-ranking state positions , for instance that of the monarch , based on their birth ? 
My country ' s new constitution does not apply such discrimination . 
Do you find it acceptable that the Union has Member States , for instance the United Kingdom , that do not have a unified written constitution ? 
My country ' s new constitution is a democratic , written constitution . 
Do you find it acceptable that the Union has Member States , for instance France , whose constitution does not contain fundamental rights ? 
My country ' s new constitution not only contains fundamental rights , but it is the first in the European Union to take the European Charter of Fundamental Rights as a standard . 
Do you think it is acceptable that the Union has Member States where there is no constitutional court , or where there is one , but its powers are weak ? 
My country ' s new constitution is proud to guarantee a strong constitutional protection . 
You claim to act in the spirit of a common Europe when you drag the new Hungarian constitution here for dissection . 
In effect , however , you are betraying one of the most important principles of the Treaty of Lisbon , namely Article 4(2): ' The Union shall respect the equality of Member States before the Treaties as well as their national identities , inherent in their fundamental structures , political and constitutional ' . 
If you have not organised or will not organise debates concerning the states I have mentioned above , or failed to remember here , in the European Parliament , that the socialist government of Hungary blatantly ignored the right to assembly in 2006 , then you , ladies and gentlemen , are using double measures . 
You can see the mote in your brother ' s eye but not the beam in your own . 
You do not realise that you are not supporting European cooperation with this attitude , but you are provoking conflicts between the European nations . 
This reveals your real partisan bias . 
I would suggest you follow the example set by the new Hungarian constitution in your countries . 
Curb indebtedness by constitutional methods to prevent another Greek , Irish , or Portuguese crisis from happening . 
I suggest you protect with constitutional methods the rights of future generations , just as the new Hungarian constitution does , raising environmental , budgetary , and demographic sustainability to the level of constitutional principles . 
Protect your nationalities and minorities , for instance the Roma , with strong , collective rights , just as the new Hungarian constitution does , uniquely in Europe . 
You keep repeating unjustified charges , although we have disproved them and have proved our position time and time again , but I am telling you once more: the new Hungarian constitution does not ban abortion . 
The new Hungarian constitution does not prejudice the freedom of religion and freedom of conscience . 
The new Hungarian constitution does not restrict the rights of same-sex people . 
The new Hungarian constitution has no competence beyond the country ' s geographical area and provides unparalleled , strong legal protection for the nationalities within its area . 
The new Hungarian constitution does not weaken , but strengthens the principles of division of power , and checks and balances . 
The new Hungarian constitution is a European constitution in spirit , born in the spirit of ensuring all fundamental human rights to its citizens , and of cooperation and unity of nations . 
In our constitution , there are 18 references to Europe , and we included ' Unity in diversity ' , the motto of the European Union , in it as well . 
Ladies and gentlemen , we , Hungarians , are a nation that likes freedom and democracy . 
We do not need to be lectured about democracy by those who have plenty of homework to do in their own backyards . 
Madam President , the European Union is a union of values and a union in law . 
It is defined as an instance of supranational integration of Member States , each one of which is a reputably constitutional state . 
There is also a constitutional dimension to the European Union itself , however , insofar as not only is the architecture of its institutions subject to the law but there are also guarantees enshrined in law to protect the position of individuals with regard to the government authorities in Europe , and there exists an essential principle , that of democracy , which exalts pluralism . 
That is surely why this revision of the Hungarian constitution is being debated in the European Parliament and has been the subject of consideration by two of this House ' s committees in particular , namely , the Committee on Constitutional Affairs (AFCO) and the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) . 
I think the primary concern can be summarised as the one underlying the impression that what is certainly a very large political majority , a two-thirds majority , but nonetheless a circumstantial political majority in the Hungarian Parliament , has succeeded in forcing a constitutional reform that places constraints on the achievement of political pluralism and , consequently , on the possibility of alternating between different political projects under the same set of rules of play . 
I think that is why it has caused concern , from the point of view of its concordance with the principles enshrined in Articles 2 and 3 of the Treaty on European Union and with the political dimension of the rights enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union . 
No one has sought to prejudge what the Hungarian constitution will be or how it will be applied in practice and it will , of course , be subject to the checks and balances provided by the constitutional system , the constitutional balance of the Hungarian constitution itself and the fact that Hungary is subject to supranational bodies such as the Council of Europe and the European Union , which know about fundamental rights . 
I must refer , however , to what I have just heard regarding the protection of minorities under the Spanish constitution , which has been set up as an example to some other constitutions that have been mentioned by Mr Szájer . 
I cannot overlook this . 
With all due respect , I must inform Mr Szájer that no shadow of discrimination by reason of origin or birth exists in the Spanish constitution . 
No one is seeking to prejudge the outcome of the implementation of the Hungarian constitution but I do think that this Parliament is concerned that the Hungarian constitution must also adhere to the rule of accreditation of political pluralism and the alternation of different political projects under the same set of rules of play . 
This debate and those that have preceded it are testimony to that concern . 
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , the new fundamental law of Hungary - one would say a far too controversial text for a constitution - has been rushed through the Hungarian Parliament after only one month of public consultations . 
Hungarian civil society and the Venice Commission have expressed serious concerns regarding the duration and transparency of the process . 
Sometimes , those questioning this text have been accused of doing so for purely political reasons . 
One expected the new Hungarian constitution - 20 years after the fall of the Communist regime and at a time when Hungary holds the Presidency of the European Union - to entirely reflect the most cherished values in the EU . 
Are these only political values ? 
I admit that as a Liberal , I am worried about government eroding civil liberties and democratic control . 
I am worried about legislation turning a blind eye to diversity , and I am convinced that not all Hungarian citizens recognise themselves in the conservative image portrayed by the constitution . 
How could I remain indifferent about a text on pluralism and the concentration of power in regulatory authorities such as those set out in the still fresh Hungarian media law ? 
We should all worry about democracy when a ruling party passes laws that cement its power well beyond the end of its term and limits the relevance of future elections , and about political leaders going as far as writing or amending fundamental laws that fit only their political credo or economic policies . 
And yes , I am worried about the spill-over of these Hungarian patterns . 
My own country ' s leaders have been inspired by these actions , and some recent amendments to our Romanian constitution seem to be copied and pasted . 
They will not be approved , but the attempt is there . 
European institutions must not be shy at such times . 
We need to strive to make all European citizens feel not worried but reassured that our values are at the core of our legislation and are there to stay . 
on behalf of the ECR Group . - Madam President , Commissioner , this debate is an evaluation of the situation regarding the new Hungarian constitution , not the common law of the United Kingdom which has protected our citizens for nearly 900 years . 
It is the Commission which is charged with assessing and acting on such issues as are laid out in the Treaties , and as requested by this Parliament only a few months ago . 
This House was hoping to ask the Commission what its conclusions are and how it intends to proceed , and we still look forward to your guidance , but it seems we have to wait a little bit longer . 
This is a Union of different cultures and differing priorities . 
However , we all share values of freedom , fairness and equality for every person and every Member State . 
What we should not tolerate is intolerance itself . 
What we ask now is for you , Commissioner , to give this House , as soon as possible , a definitive answer as to whether the Hungarian constitution is in line with European legislation and fundamental rights . 
If it is not , what next ? 
If it is , Commissioner , we need to know that , too , as soon as we can . 
Madam President , I thank my fellow Member from the European People ' s Party (Christian Democrats) who wants to start a debate with us here about the Hungarian constitution . 
That is laudable , because when I hear the representative of the European Council say ' We have not discussed this in the Council ' , and when I hear Commissioner Reding say ' A country ' s constitution is up to that country alone and it is not for us , at European level , to interfere with that ' , then I am glad that we in the European Parliament are , indeed , having this debate amongst ourselves . 
Are we really not supposed to get involved ? 
Is this a purely Hungarian affair ? 
I would not say so . 
The state of democracy in a Member State of the EU does concern the other Member States . 
If a country chooses to use a fair election and a two-thirds majority to create an autocracy , the rest of us are allowed to be shocked by that and to try and oppose it . 
I quote György Konrád here , who says: ' In Hungary , a so-called majority knows how to create an autocratic regime in a democratic way ' . 
That is true . 
If you push a law through the Hungarian Parliament and decree that , from now on , it may only be amended with a two-thirds majority , you know that it is not going be easy to amend it again after the next election . 
This sort of thing erodes the function of elections as a democratic instrument . 
It is the right of a nation to say every four years , ' We liked this , but we did not like that ' , and to then bring about changes . 
However , if a democratically elected regime sets things up so that no amendments can be made for many years after , that is unhealthy and wrong . 
If we in Europe avert our eyes and say ' This is purely a Hungarian affair ' , if 26 Member States are not prepared to say , ' Friends , we do not treat people like that in our society ' , and if the European Commission says the same , what should we then say , as a group , to countries where the situation is even worse ? 
What should we tell those Hungarians who are not part of the two-thirds majority ? 
 ' Terribly sorry , you will not have any chance to reverse these laws after the next two elections , either ' . 
I find it absolutely appalling that all of us in Europe are averting our eyes and that we are failing to take action . 
Madam President , in this debate on the Hungarian constitution , we have , in fact , been having two debates . 
One is on the debate on the content of the constitution , and the other is a debate about the debate; in other words , on knowing whether it is legitimate or not to make pronouncements on the content of the Hungarian constitution in this Parliament or in any other institution outside of Hungary itself . 
Regarding the debate on the content , we know that there are many parts that are of concern to us in Parliament , to the specific committees that have debated this document , or to the Venice Commission , for example . 
The issue of non-discrimination . . . Mr Szájer tells us that it is not true that discrimination against , for example , gender or sexual minorities is not provided for , because there is a reference to all types of discrimination . 
As far as I am concerned , that reference is too vague and leaves too much room for subsequent court judgments contradicting it . 
It should be stipulated in the constitution , as is the norm in European countries , and as is the norm in the most advanced and progressive democracies . 
The same goes for the foetus , the protection of the foetus , or , for example , for the Hungarian Republic ' s checks and balances . 
However , we then have the debate about the debate , and the debate about the legitimacy of this issue being pronounced on in Parliament must also be fought very clearly . 
This is because , firstly , constitutions are not watertight . 
It needs to be said that wherever there are violations of fundamental rights , the 500 million citizens expect the European institutions to make pronouncements . 
Whether that violation is made by a law , by a constitution , or by a regulation , is irrelevant: wherever there is a violation of fundamental rights , it is not permitted under the Treaties . 
Secondly , the explanation that , due to cultural differences , a constitution may be , let us say , free from criticism , is pure constitutional relativism . 
That cannot be the case . 
The fact of a constitution violating the spirit and letter of the Treaties , if that were the case , means it would be violating the sovereignty of the other 26 countries that have agreed to be in a European Union with the country that was able to violate the Treaties . 
It is therefore an issue for the sovereignty of all . 
I would like to take this opportunity to just say one thing . 
The two-thirds majority - very often invoked here , and which , in fact , comes from 50% rather than two thirds of the votes cast by Hungarian citizens , since they make up two thirds of the Members of the Hungarian Parliament , but only 50% of the votes - serves for one thing everywhere: to confer a broad social consensus on the constitution . 
Those in power in Hungary have just used the two-thirds majority for exactly the opposite purpose: to exclude the opposition , ensuring that the constitution is extremely controversial in their society . 
It may be following the letter of the two-thirds rule , but it is violating its spirit . 
(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))
(BG) Mr Tavares , I have a very brief question for you . 
On whose authority do you speak on behalf of all 500 million European citizens ? 
This is because you are speaking out very boldly on their behalf . 
However , I think that if Europe ' s citizens were to be consulted , their comments will not reflect exactly what you have said . 
Everyone in this Parliament has different views and represents different sections of European citizens . 
Therefore , on whose authority do you speak on behalf of all of them ? 
Madam President , Mr Stoyanov , I would encourage you to read the Union Treaties and the Rules of Procedure of this House , which state that we , being elected by the European citizens , should represent our own Member States and citizens , and the 500 million citizens of the European Union as a whole . 
We are given a mandate by those citizens to respect and to make others respect the fundamental Treaties of the European Union , which protect the rights of their citizens . 
It is very simple: whilst we have such a mandate , Mr Stoyanov and I have as much a right as each other to speak on behalf of the 500 million European citizens in this House , which belongs to the citizens . 
Madam President , the revised Hungarian constitution of April this year has become the subject of justified criticism by the whole of European democratic society . 
It has introduced into the Hungarian legal system provisions which ignore international law and are in direct conflict with the accepted international obligations of the Hungarian Republic . 
The ruling Fidesz party has introduced into the constitution versions of texts through which Hungary usurps the right to decide on the status , rights and political organisation of all Hungarian-speaking citizens in surrounding states . 
It has also reserved the right to provide all of these citizens of surrounding states , who have no links to Hungary whatsoever , with Hungarian citizenship , the right to vote in Hungary , the right to social security or education under Hungarian regulations and universal Hungarian diplomatic protection . 
Under international law , the organisation of a political system is a sovereign matter of sovereign states , and therefore we cannot view the provisions of the Hungarian constitution under which Hungary reserves the right to decide on the organisation of the life of citizens of other states as anything other than a primitive and crude attack on calm and peaceful coexistence in Europe . 
The idea of one nation , one empire and so on is not new . 
This swarthy little Hitler , who has abused it for the last time in his desire for power and glory in Europe , was long ago condemned by the decent , civilised and democratic world . 
I would therefore like to believe that democratic political forces in the Hungarian Parliament will correct all of the errors in another legislative process , and will amend the constitution to bring it into line with international law and Hungary ' s international obligations . 
(BG) Madam President , I think that Parliament should apologise to the Commissioner for getting her involved in this debate . 
This is because it has become patently obvious to everyone in this Chamber from what she said - at least it is basically to me , but I do not know whether it has become clear to everyone else - that new legislation implementing Hungary ' s constitution still needs to be adopted , and then it will become clear whether anyone ' s rights are being violated . 
We are in a situation once again where a debate is going on here in Parliament intended to condemn a Member State for something which it has not yet done . 
Fellow Members , in which of your Member States is anyone judged for something which they have not done ? 
Or condemned for something which they have not done ? 
None . 
This is something that contradicts democratic values . 
The people who initiated this debate must apologise not only to the Commissioner , but also to all European citizens , because it is precisely this kind of behaviour from Parliament which leads to a lack of interest from European citizens in its activities , disappointment and low voter turnout in European Parliament elections . 
Madam President , this debate on the Hungarian constitution today is flawed for two main reasons . 
It singles out one Member State out of 27 , and it concerns a national issue which falls within the sovereignty of Member States . 
First of all , if we are going to discuss the content of a constitution , we should not single out one constitution of one Member State . 
We should , if anything , debate the constitutions of each and every Member State . 
Some of the elements which are being contested can , in fact , be found in a number of other constitutions in other Member States , and yet we are only debating one constitution in one Member State . 
This is wrong . 
Secondly , one has to ask what power , what competence , do we have to bring the issue of a national constitution to the European Parliament in the first place ? 
Member States have a sovereign competence for establishing their own national constitutions , and in this case , we should respect the right of the Hungarian people to determine their own constitution adopted by their democratically-elected national parliament . 
The debate we are having today on the content of this constitution should , if anything , be held amongst Hungarian people , and not in this House . 
Whether we like it or not , whether we disagree or agree with this national constitution , we must respect the sovereignty and the hierarchy of law , otherwise we would be setting a dangerous precedent . 
So when we single out a Member State , and when we try to act outside our competence , we send a wrong signal . 
We would stand accused of political instrumentalisation , and we would be undermining the trust of citizens in our own institution . 
We should not go down this dangerous road . 
(SK) Madam President , on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament , I would like to declare unambiguously that we recognise the right of all EU Member States to make their own laws , and thus we do not want to criticise either Hungary or , in particular , the citizens of Hungary . 
Our comments and concerns are not directed towards a criticism of Hungary and Hungarian citizens , but we firmly believe that the defence of fundamental rights , civic freedoms , our shared European values , and peace , security and decent coexistence is a sufficient reason for us to hold this discussion today . 
We also hope that the discussion and presentation of our questions and concerns can lead to improvement and to better preparation of the implementing legislation mentioned earlier . 
Commissioner , just like you , we want to stick to the procedure ensuring that this entire process is conducted correctly , and we await the final opinion of the Venice Commission , although it is now clear from the preliminary conclusions presented in the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs by the Secretary of the Venice Commission , Mr Markert , that the current Hungarian constitution is , in a number of points , controversial to say the least . 
Weak points have been seen in the Hungarian constitution not only by the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , but also by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs . 
If we ignore the Romantic , almost monarchist ideas which pervade the spirit of the preamble , I would like to mention some areas we regard as being highly sensitive , in contrast to our fellow Members from Fidesz who are also Members of the European Parliament . 
One example is the principle mentioned earlier for adopting the constitution . 
It is not very normal in democratic countries for a consultation process to last only five weeks . 
It is not normal for the opposition not to participate in it , and , despite the fact that Fidesz has the necessary majority , it has to be said that victors have a duty to show humility . 
The restriction on the powers of the constitutional court has already been mentioned , and on behalf of our group , I would also like to mention the discriminatory nature of the constitution in relation to members of sexual minorities , as it fails to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation . 
The protection of Hungarian minorities abroad , to which Article D applies directly , also applies to people of Hungarian ethnicity living in neighbouring countries . 
Ladies and gentlemen , the mission of the European Union is surely for us to live together as nations and as states of the European Union in peace , cooperation and mutual respect . 
How should we , from the countries directly affected , perceive this constitution ? 
How can you expect us to accept it ? 
Unlike you , we have always extended the hand of friendship to you , and we have always wanted decent coexistence , and we would therefore like the implementing regulations for your constitution to respect the sovereignty of neighbouring states in the region . 
Madam President , it is untenable to say that the constitution of a Member State is a matter only for itself . 
The Treaties , in Articles 6 and 7 , make it crystal clear not only that the Union and the Member States share certain values , but that the Commission has the duty to police respect for those values . 
I wholly subscribe to what my colleague , Renate Weber , eloquently said: I do think it a bit rich for those of the same political persuasion as the ruling Fidesz party in Hungary to accuse critics of that constitution of being politically inspired . 
Many of the provisions of this constitution are very partisan , such as the omission of protection of gay people from discrimination and the giving of extra votes to mothers . 
But I want to give a good example of one flaw in the constitution that undermines the Treaty ' s insistence on the rule of law . 
This is the declaration that the 1949 constitution is invalid . 
Not just repealed , but invalid . 
This creates great legal uncertainty as it leaves in limbo , and apparently invalid themselves , laws passed under that constitution including in respect of Hungary ' s accession and EU membership . 
This is one reason why the Commission should examine it for compliance with EU law and it could have a great effect on other Member States . 
Madam President , the new Hungarian constitution demolishes the pillars of a democracy based on the rule of law and opens the way to autocracy . 
This is a major setback on the road of transition . 
The process of preparing and adopting the new constitution was hardly legitimate . 
The preamble is exclusionary and reflects a distorted interpretation of history . 
The main text represents an intrusion into private life , basic human and citizens ' rights are defined in a narrow way , social rights are substituted by state objectives . 
Checks and balances are weakened , especially the independence of the judiciary . 
The European Council , Parliament and Commission cannot ignore these violations of European values , because this may set a negative precedent for other illiberal regimes to follow . 
Nevertheless , the democrats of Hungary do not expect the remedy to come from abroad . 
Were it to happen that way , it would only reinforce the view of the Hungarian Prime Minister , who compared the EU to the Soviet Union . 
The solution can come only from the Hungarian citizens , who will reject this constitution when they realise that an autocratic regime cannot provide high living standards and more freedom . 
Twenty-one years ago , we were not required to fight for freedom . 
Now we are . 
In the meantime , Europe should keep its watchful eye on Hungary and encourage the Hungarian democrats to regain the initiative . 
Madam President , I strongly disagree with all of those who have said that it is not respecting sovereignty if we debate and criticise a Member State ' s constitution here , or that it would , as somebody has said , be a dangerous precedent and acting outside of European competence . 
The constitutions of Member States have to be in accordance with European values , with our value community which we have defined . 
There are at least two things I would like to mention which are not in line with that . 
Others have mentioned others . 
The first is that discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation is not included and that has to be included in the future . 
Also , marriage and family values as defined there go beyond the reality of people living in Europe and in Hungary , and it is not the rule of diversity that we have . 
One other thing relates to the so-called Green Ombudsman for the rights of future generations on environment and sustainability . 
This post is now subordinated to the general Ombudsman , as other Ombudsmen have been , and so it is weakened . 
This is also an area where competences are taken out of the sphere of regulations that were there before , and it makes clear that the issue of sustainability , environmental protection and the rights of future generations - another part of European values - which needs to be important , is no longer as important as it was before . 
One last point: there was also an Ombudsman on data protection . 
That post has been abolished totally , so transparency of information about the State , for example on public procurement , is not there anymore . 
This is something that is heavily criticised by me and by my group . 
(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))
(HU) Mrs Lunacek , I would like to ask you whether you can list the Member States of the European Union whose constitution includes the institution of an ombudsman or commissioner for the rights of future generations . 
How many Member States have such an institution as the one in Hungary that is actually functioning and is mentioned in the Hungarian constitution ? 
Also , assuming you have read the current Hungarian constitution , the new Hungarian constitution adopted in April , can you name constitutions which contain more and farther reaching articles on environmental protection and future generations than the new Hungarian constitution ? 
I challenge you to name them . 
Madam President , my reply to Ms Gál is as follows . 
The issue was not a comparison with other Member States ' constitutions . 
The issue was: what is a European value ? 
What is part of our fundamental rights ? 
What is enshrined in the common values that I hope you share as well ? 
With regard to the rights of future generations , environmental sustainability is something that is enshrined in the rights of our common European Union . 
Some Member States have that and others might not have it , but the fact is that in the new constitution , the government of Hungary has abolished this symbolic Ombudsman . 
There is now only one Ombudsman and the symbolic value , stated in writing , is no longer there . 
You know how important symbols are in politics as well . 
That means that you do not want to have this symbolic representation , either at the political or the Ombudsman level . 
(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))
Madam President , maybe it was not understandable , but I shall make the question more simple . 
Ms Lunacek , in your country - I know you are from Austria - is there a Green Ombudsman ? 
In Hungary , there was a Green Ombudsman several years ago and there will be one , according to the new constitution . 
Is there a Green Ombudsman in your country ? 
Yes , or no ? 
Madam President , I must say to Mr Szájer: sorry , that is not the problem . 
Hungary had a Green . . . 
(Laughter)
OK , laugh if you want to . 
I do not mind laughter , I like humour , but the issue is that , with the new constitution in Hungary , this Green Ombudsman has been abolished and he has been subordinated . 
All the four Ombudsmen or Ombudswomen that existed have been subordinated to one general office of the Ombudsman . 
The issue of sustainability of future generations is not as visible as it was before and that is the criticism I have . 
My country does not have such a post . 
Of course , as a Green , I would fight for that , but you have written a new constitution and this abolishes a symbolic and a political value that I guess was important to you , as you say now . 
Why did you abolish it then ? 
Why did you not keep it there so that everybody could see a Green Ombudsman who is in favour of the rights of future generations , environment and sustainability ? 
You have not explained that , colleagues . 
(IT) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I am truly astounded by the instrumental tone of this debate . 
Thinking back also to the recent statements made by Mrs Lunacek , I will refrain from discussing , for example , the topic of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation . 
In my country ' s constitution , there is no mention of this issue , and so when will the European Parliament be holding a debate on the Italian constitution ? 
Moreover , it is rather strange because , in my country , the only party that wants to change the constitution is Mr Berlusconi ' s centre-right party . 
For 15 years , the response of the Left has been that we must not change the constitution or it will be the end of democracy . 
Be careful then because , when we open a debate on what a constitutional text does or does not contain , perhaps we should first of all clear up a misunderstanding . 
Do we really think that the fact that this constitution mentions the rights of the unborn child constitutes a risk for modernity ? 
Do we really think that the fact that the Christian roots of a country are mentioned in this constitution constitutes a risk for identity ? 
As far as I am concerned , I think we should all familiarise ourselves a little more with the text of the European constitution , which did not actually materialise but which had the motto ' United in diversity ' , and try to be a little more tolerant of the fact that everyone is different . 
In other words , we have to understand that at the moment , a broad consensus in Hungary has highlighted the needs of a people , and in order to avoid those needs turning into nationalism , it must be supported by a strong Europe that recognises everyone ' s rights and duties . 
(HU) Madam President , the Treaty on the European Union states that the European Union is based on respect for freedom , democracy , rule of law and human rights . 
These values are shared by the Member States . 
The Copenhagen Criteria are based on these values , which also form part of the accession conditions . 
The European institutions are also responsible for ensuring that Member States comply with these principles after accession , as well . 
Let me remind all of you of this responsibility and , in particular , the President of the Commission and the Commissioner who bear primary responsibility in this respect . 
Neither the contents of the new Hungarian constitution nor the circumstances of its drafting comply with these basic principles . 
Therefore , the questions related to this matter can be considered European , not national issues . 
One single party adopted this constitution , without public or professional consultations , and its draftsmen have dubious democratic legitimacy . 
The democratic opposition parties requested legal guarantees that the new constitution would be based on broad public consensus , and in the absence of this , they withdrew from the constitutional process . 
The two main tasks of the constitution are to ensure human rights and proper functioning of the state . 
However , the framework for the proper functioning of the state is problematic . 
According to the new constitution , amendments to the tax system , the pension system and family support system must be adopted by a two-thirds majority . 
This will impede the candidates of subsequent elections to promise changes concerning these matters , and will impede the voters in free election . 
Furthermore , the constitution invests the Budget Council , a body that is not elected directly , with the power of veto over the decisions of Parliament concerning the budget , which , in turn , may result in the dissolution of Parliament and a call for new elections , thereby threatening stable governance . 
The level of protection of human rights is decreased . 
Human rights will be enforced less effectively , as the competence of the constitutional court is limited . 
The most important acquis of the EU is that by its values , it has been able to channel conflicts which , in the past , could only be solved at the cost of considerable human suffering into a democratic framework based on the rule of law . 
The EU offers to and demands from its Member States a clear framework for the rule of law , constitutional guarantees , institutional checks and balances , and negotiated solutions . 
These values should be preserved . 
Madam President , in this House , we have discussed media freedom being under pressure in Italy , Slovakia and Hungary . 
We have discussed the violation of LGBT rights in Lithuania , Hungary , and Poland . 
We have discussed the expulsion of and discrimination against Roma people in France and Italy , and there have been many other examples of debates about fundamental rights being under pressure in one Member State or another . 
Every single time , I have heard the EPP say that this should not be party politics and that we should not single out Member States . 
This is not about Member States , this is about fundamental rights . 
Fundamental rights is not a matter of subsidiarity . 
Fundamental rights is about the very foundations of the European Union . 
In order to demonstrate this , I remind you that we ask candidate countries to adapt not only their laws but also their constitutions in order to be admitted as members of the European Union . 
Clearly , colleagues , there are objective concerns that have been expressed not only by political parties but also by the Venice Commission , and , at the very least , there are ambiguities . 
Instead of having this very acrimonious debate , we should try and clarify the issues . 
One last practical suggestion to the Hungarian Government . 
If you want to demonstrate your very strong commitment to the protection and promotion of LGBT rights , I would invite you to walk with Budapest Gay Pride on 18 June . 
(DE) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , fundamental human rights are universal , which means that they are applicable in every situation . 
I have been listening to the debate . 
None of the speakers so far , including the critics , has quoted the constitution to indicate exactly what it is they do not like . 
Mr López Aguilar says that he gets the impression that something has gone awry , while others are making insinuations about all the things that could go wrong with this constitution . 
Not one person has actually quoted from the constitution itself . 
That is precisely the problem that faces us in this discussion: where are the actual accusations ? 
When I consider how the Hungarians will react to this debate and to the accusations being bandied about by some of my fellow Members without any support from direct quotations , then I can well imagine that some will find the way that the Hungarians and their country ' s development are being discussed here to be extremely arrogant . 
As Europeans , we should take care to avoid leaving ourselves open to such accusations . 
I would like to state that many of those in positions of responsibility in Hungary today are the people who took to the streets to fight against communism and for liberty . 
It is simply unacceptable that accusations should be continuously made against these people and that the impression should be created that they are experiencing problems with freedom . 
This has nothing to do with party politics; it is simply a fact . 
Having complained that no quotes have been used during this debate , I would now like to quote from the new Hungarian constitution: ' We are proud of the fact that our country has been part of Christian Europe for 1 000 years and we are aware of the role of Christianity in sustaining our nation ' . 
I am pleased to find such sentiments in a constitution . 
This may not please all Members of this House . 
I am pleased that this reference to Christianity has been included and I would also have liked to have seen it included in the Treaty of Lisbon and in the European constitution . 
My position , as a representative of the European People ' s Party (Christian Democrats) is that this is a good thing . 
Madam President , we are not simply discussing domestic problems in the European Parliament . 
European values are being questioned in the new Hungarian constitution . 
Therefore , we have to discuss it and have to do so now . 
There is still time before the adoption of the generic laws . 
I hope everyone agrees that the constitution has to be balanced , close to the citizens , based on generally accepted values and principles , and should be party neutral . 
Sadly , the Hungarian constitution does not fulfil these criteria . 
Even the adoption of the document is questionable . 
There was no , or very little , social consultation . 
The text is only supported by one political party and it is opposed by major constitutional experts . 
The new constitution raises questions on an international level . 
For example , there is a lack of reference to EU law in the closing provisions . 
We note clear differences , and comparing the text to the Charter of Fundamental Rights , the text shows inconsistencies and differences in values and principles . 
The principle of good governance does not prevail in the document either . 
The constitution fails to provide an EU-conforming , modern , administrative structure . 
The aforementioned generic laws are very dangerous . 
They make governing the country almost impossible for any future government . 
We have the impression , as one of our colleagues has put it , that the government is like a football team trying to change the rules and the referee during a game . 
This is not the way to treat political opponents and this is certainly not how democracy works in the 21st century in Europe . 
(DE) Madam President , I have a lot of sympathy with the position of the Group of the European People ' s Party (Christian Democrats) in other areas . 
We work closely together on economic issues . 
However , in this particular case , we must make it clear that we should not play party politics here . 
Above all , we must emphasise that it is scandalous to criticise the constitution of a Member State in this forum , whichever Member State that may be . 
There are Member States , and here I am looking at Mr Busuttil , among others , since he brought up the issue so forcefully , who seek the support of the European Union when they experience problems; it is an expression of European solidarity that we should provide help when , for example , Malta experiences a problem with refugees . 
However , solidarity must be based on shared values , and all of the groups within this House are responsible for sustaining such values . 
Although the Charter of Fundamental Rights may only be binding on European legislation and its implementation , Articles 2 , 6 and 7 of the Treaties are binding on all Member States . 
A two-thirds majority was cemented into the Hungarian constitution , so that , realistically speaking , any future Hungarian Government will be unable to amend any of the country ' s laws . 
This goes against the principle of parliamentary democracy . 
This limiting of the powers of the constitutional court is something quite unique and threatens the principle of the separation of powers . 
We cannot discount the possibility that there is a breach of international law in relation to criminal proceedings . 
There is so much I could say , but I certainly wish to state the following: it is not just the right of the EU and the European Commission to make their voice heard in this case; it is also their duty . 
In the past - even long before the European Union existed - Europe too often held back on criticising abuses in Member States . 
My country , along with others , has experience of this . 
When the politicians remain silent , sooner or later the people will make themselves heard and then we need to ask ourselves whether it is too late and whether we have failed . 
(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))
(HU) Mr Alvaro , this is true , just one sentence . 
We agree . 
This criticism is shameful . 
My question is this: on what grounds do you base your opinion that a fundamental law adopted by a two-thirds majority cannot be changed in a democratic country ? 
It could be changed so far . 
It can be changed in other countries as well . 
Please be specific . 
Which exactly are the common values , common European values , that the Hungarian constitution excludes , rejects , or comes into conflict with ? 
Because what you are saying is too general . 
(DE) Madam President , many thanks for your question . 
I accept the criticism that I have dealt in generalities in the minute ' s speaking time allocated to me . 
However , I can provide more concrete examples . 
European values are one thing; however , European values also mean , for example , that a Member State should operate on the rule of law , which entails issues such as the separation of powers and the democratic principle . 
When , for example , a constitutional court has no jurisdiction in budgetary and taxation matters , this constitutes a restriction in the separation of powers and is unquestionably a dubious situation . 
Accordingly , I believe that we can discuss such issues . 
With regard to the other questions , such as the two-thirds majority , I must ask to what extent this is compatible with parliamentary democracy if future governments no longer have any room to manoeuvre . 
It is certainly open to question whether life imprisonment without any right of appeal or judicial review by the supreme court is compatible with the principles of democracy and the rule of law upheld in the European Union . 
These are questions that need answers and I believe that the Commission must investigate . 
(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))
(HU) Mr Alvaro , I would like to ask you whether you are aware that the Hungarian constitution previously in force specified 27 laws that could only be modified by a two-thirds majority , while the new constitution specifies only 26 . 
What is the problem here ? 
A recent scholarly analysis came up with this number; it is not my own calculation . 
(DE) Madam President , I believe that people will forgive me if I answer a question based on a subjective opinion with a subjective opinion of my own . 
No , I do not think it is the most modern . 
(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))
(DE) Madam President , Mr Alvaro , you have just demonstrated how to extend your speaking time by accepting numerous questions . 
However , I would like to ask you whether you are aware that the provisions for the Hungarian constitutional court - I am not sure whether you have read the Hungarian constitution in its entirety - are almost identical to those that apply to the constitutional court in Germany . 
Therefore , I wanted to ask you whether the German constitutional court is just as undemocratic and worthy of criticism as the Hungarian constitutional court ? 
I would like to hear your answer to this question . 
(DE) Madam President , Mr Weber , as you have just stated that it is only identical in certain sections , it is quite clear that there are also sections where it may be open to question whether the fact that the Hungarian constitution circumscribes the jurisdiction of the constitutional court in tax and budgetary issues is compatible with the principle of the separation of powers . 
If you were now to tell me that the German constitutional court could not decide on tax issues , for example , following a judgment by the German Federal Court of Justice , or if budget law could not be examined by the German constitutional court for example , by way of a constitutional dispute between government institutions , such as a party in the German Bundestag , then I would agree with you . 
However , the German constitution does permit this , while also allowing a case to be taken to the German constitutional court in such questions . 
(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))
Madam President , I would like to refer to something that was mentioned before; the rights of future generations . 
It looks very unique in the Hungarian constitution , something that is being enshrined in the Hungarian constitution , and recognised seemingly also here . 
This raises a question I would like to ask about the basic right of those eventual members of future generations - to be born . 
Is caring about future human beings a European value - or not ? 
Maybe not European , only Hungarian ? 
Then Europe should look to Hungary with gratitude for reminding it of some fundamentals . 
(DE) Madam President , I hold Mr Landsbergis in high esteem . 
However , I am unable to find a question in his speech . 
If this was not a question , then I will use the time to make a statement . 
As far as I am aware , no constitution defines the law for future generations . 
That is not the issue at stake . 
What we are dealing with is human dignity - this is a principle found in the German constitution , as well as others - and the Hungarian constitution is no different in this regard . 
I cannot see a contradiction here . 
The question is whether this is to be restricted or defined in future . 
However , as I said before , I failed to understand your question completely . 
Sustainability , the protection of future generations , the desire for a healthy natural environment and the protection of quality of life - all of these are principles that , if I am not mistaken , can be found in the constitutions of all Member States , and that have been upheld in many supreme court judgments . 
I believe that this principle was never questioned by you , even during your time as President . 
(HU) Madam President , I would like to reassure my fellow Members and Mr Alvaro that Hungary is a state where the rule of law still prevails . 
I would like to reassure Mrs in ' t Veld , Mrs Göncz and Mrs Benova that Hungary still respects fundamental rights , human rights and the values of the Union . 
Hungarian laws and the constitution adopted in April comply with the laws and basic values of the European Union . 
Hungary is maintaining all her international legal obligations and commitments and , in fact , this is clearly stated in the text of the constitution , and if it were not the case , then the Commission would take it to the Court of Justice in Luxembourg to challenge it in a formal procedure; but we all know in this Chamber that this is not the case . 
Fellow Members , the question of what is included in the constitution of a country and what is dealt with at a different legislative level by a certain Member State is something that is quite clearly a matter of national sovereignty . 
In a democracy based on popular representation , it is up to the MPs elected in free elections to decide which areas should be dealt with at a constitutional level , and which areas should be dealt with at a general legislative level . 
What I do not understand about this debate is that up until now , we have been taught that laws that can be modified by a two-thirds majority are there to provide a guarantee that they cannot be abused . 
We need a two-thirds majority constitution because this is a rule that provides guarantees . 
Now we hear that many raise objections against the very two-thirds majority that they had previously seen as a guarantee . 
I personally feel that you are incapable of accepting the rules of the game of democracy . 
In addition , as my colleagues have already pointed out , the new Hungarian constitution refers to the Charter of Fundamental Rights , which is a new constitutional element , and considers the minorities of Hungary as an integral part of the Hungarian political community . 
The Hungarian Parliamentary Commissioner for Future Generations said that it elevates environmental protection and responsibility for future generations to an outstanding level . 
The way we speak about this constitution , we could be talking about any other European constitution . 
You always talk about difference , and emphasise that if something reflects a different value , it does not mean that it is better or worse . 
It is simply different , and as a Hungarian , I would be grateful if you could respect this in the spirit of unity in diversity . 
(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))
(SK) Madam President , today I received an invitation to the exhibition ' Bridges Between Nations ' , an event organised by your colleague . 
In this invitation , he used the motto of the founder of the EU , Jean Monnet , who said that the Union was built by people . 
Mrs Gál , constitutions and bridges must also be built by people . 
I would like to ask you why the coalition in Hungary does not want the opposition to participate in the process of drawing up the constitution . 
(HU) The opposition had the opportunity to participate in the work of Parliament . 
The opposition decided not to participate in this work and we respect their decision . 
Instead , as we can see , they wish to carry out a debate here , which is something that the Hungarian public does not really understand . 
(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))
(DE) Madam President , no , in fact this is basically quite simple . 
Having heard from others that other Member States should put their own house in order and examine their constitutions , perhaps Mrs Gál could quote an article from the constitution of one of the Member States of the European Union that she would categorise as an example of an area where a state needs to ' put its own house in order ' . 
After all , it was Mrs Gál who explicitly stated that that is what other Member States should do . 
In other words , where is the specific criticism of the constitution of another Member State that needs to be addressed ? 
Once we have this information , we can , of course , get down to discussions . 
(HU) It is not stated at a constitutional level that everyone should set their own houses in order . 
Mr Alvaro , I said to you as well , as a Liberal MEP , that those who respect and emphasise the right to being different in all areas should be prepared to accept that being different can appear in the spirit , in the choice of values and the structures of the constitutions . 
This is what I wanted to say . 
This does not mean that we do not respect the basic values of the EU , or we do not comply fully with the requirements set out in European law or international law . 
(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))
(HU) Mrs Gál , I would like to give an answer as to why the previous rule stating that amendments to the constitution could only be accepted with the support of a four-fifths majority of MPs had to be changed . 
This rule , which had been accepted by a parliamentary majority that obtained 72% of the votes between 1994 and 1998 to protect the rights of political minorities and the opposition , was abolished by Fidesz . 
What was the reason for this ? 
The opposition did not participate in the work in the absence of this guarantee; it was not a case of being deprived of this right , as this rule had been changed . 
Commissioner Reding , I would like to draw your attention to this . 
(HU) Mr Tabajdi , I have not been a Member of the Hungarian Parliament since 1990 , but my colleagues , who were Members , or even party group leaders and speakers of the House at the time , claim that there was no such rule in force . 
This is not true . 
I think you should carry out this debate in the Hungarian Parliament; this is completely outside the scope of the debates in the European Parliament . 
(SK) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the new Hungarian constitution really is perhaps the most reactionary constitution in Europe . 
That is one side of the issue , but the other side is that it is also dangerous on an international level . 
Some honourable Members here have said that this is a sovereign matter for Hungary . 
That is true , but this constitution violates the sovereignty of other states . 
Commissioner , this is a matter of the utmost importance . 
It undermines the peace settlement of Europe . 
It undermines borders between states . 
It openly takes advantage of minorities in neighbouring countries for extreme nationalist ends . 
It is saturated with the spirit of Greater Hungary . 
In the context of granting citizenship on a purely ethnic basis , regardless of residence , employment or family ties , it opens a Pandora ' s Box of extreme nationalism such as we have not seen since the end of the Second World War . 
That is not all . 
It makes it possible to grant voting rights to Hungarians permanently living in neighbouring countries . 
Can you imagine Hungarian political parties mounting an election campaign in another country ? 
In short , the new Hungarian constitution will lead to the total destabilisation of Central Europe . 
It brings the spirit of the Balkan wars to Central Europe . 
The Speaker of the Hungarian Parliament , László Kövér , recently said in connection with the Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros dam that military intervention was required from the Hungarian side , and that the Paris Peace Treaties did not apply to Slovakia , and he also questioned Slovakia ' s borders in the context of the spirit of this constitution . 
I think it is time for both the European Union and European Parliament to declare a decisive ' no ' to this dangerous nationalistic policy , while there is still time . 
(FR) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , this is a fascinating debate , and yet I should like to say , perhaps rather bluntly , that we should not confuse the issue . 
This afternoon , I have the impression that we are moving away somewhat from political hypocrisy because it is not a question of criticising the constitution of a Member State of the European Union such as Hungary which , of course , is in sole charge , with its people , of its sovereignty . 
However , in this Parliament , it is a question , and in my case , a concern which relates to the EU legal system , and consequently an issue that affects the degree to which we share our common values , and to which we share how Europe has been built , by States and by the fundamental texts of the Member States and other national founding texts . 
However , there are contradictions concerning non-discrimination , the respect for minorities , problems of pluralism , and concerning opposition , which appear to be challenged . 
Therefore , ladies and gentlemen , if everything is straightforward , as some of the speakers here this afternoon appear to be saying , let the executive college ascertain whether the Hungarian text is compatible and legally compliant with the foundations of our EU platform , and things will be clear . 
The credibility of the EU legal system , and consequently of the European Union , depends on it . 
Madam President , this is a passionate , exhilarating if somewhat controversial debate , but nevertheless , I am certainly enjoying this expression of democracy . 
It has to be said that we are entitled to discuss this matter because Hungary is part of the European Union . 
But Hungary is also entitled to have a constitution and certainly this is far better than the old constitution of 1949 brought in by the Communists . 
It is a genuine effort to reflect modern values within the European context . 
While people will argue with some elements of it , it has to be stated that a constitution can always be amended by way of referendum and , if we find at European Union level that some aspects of it are not in keeping with European law and values , that can be done and taken on board . 
It has to be said as well that this constitution was passed on 18 April with 262 votes for and 44 against and that is an expression of democracy . 
People have objected to some aspects of it , for instance , to the references to Christianity and to God , but this is nothing new . 
These are found in the German , Polish and Irish constitutions . 
As a Christian-Democrat , I am absolutely delighted that there is a reference to God and Christianity , because it is a fundamental part of our culture and our history and I think it is far better to have it included than excluded and creating a godless society . 
People have also objected to granting citizenship to people outside of Hungary , but in Ireland , we have had passport facility for people who are officially living in Northern Ireland , which is in the United Kingdom . 
This has helped the situation more than it has detracted from it and we now have a better relationship with the United Kingdom than ever before , expressed by the visit of Queen Elizabeth two weeks ago . 
People have objected to the definition of marriage , the definition of life and so forth but , as I have said , if there are flaws , they can be addressed in a referendum . 
Finally , they are to be commended for including a limit to the extent of state debt , which is very important . 
If we had had that in our constitution in Ireland , we might not be in the mess we are now financially . 
So there is an awful lot of good in it and I think that if we are thinking of having a new constitution , we can learn a lot from what Hungary has done . 
Madam President , there are a number of problems with this constitution , but I want to focus on one key issue , which is that the proposed constitution does not give any protection from discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation . 
The only type of marriage that would be recognised would be one between a man and a woman . 
We have had a long fight across Europe for LGBT rights , and we cannot allow Hungary to take this retrograde step . 
Gay rights are protected by the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights . 
Not only that , but married couples of the same sex should be able to move freely around Europe and have their partnership legally recognised wherever they are . 
Yes , it is for Hungary to decide the Hungarian constitution . 
However , each Member State has the responsibility to respect the European Community that they are part of . 
The protection of LGBT people is fundamental to the European Union , and Hungary cannot disregard that . 
(SK) Madam President , today ' s Europe is based on values that unite us and that enable us to cooperate and respect one another . 
I would also like to emphasise that every state has the right to adopt its own constitution through democratically elected representatives . 
The new Hungarian constitution , however , opens up issues that are sensitive for its neighbours and which affect them . 
I am talking , for example , about Article 23 . 
This foresees the possibility of members of the Hungarian minority in neighbouring states acquiring the right to vote , on condition that they obtain Hungarian citizenship . 
It is here that the problem lies . 
The unusual criteria established for acquiring Hungarian citizenship , in other words , without a natural link to Hungary , creates the possibility of political links coming into existence between a state and citizens who have no real link to that state . 
I also see problems in the formulation of Section D . There is talk here of a single Hungarian nation , of collective rights , of support for their self-rule in other countries on the principle of ethnicity , on the responsibility of Hungary for all Hungarians . 
Thus , in paragraph 4 , there is room for possible extra-territorial impacts of this constitution . 
The Slovak Government is striving for a peaceful , businesslike discussion of these issues on a bilateral level . 
It meets with rejection , however , from Hungary . 
Since the constitution has not yet come into force , I therefore think that this is the right time to discuss it and to explain what the negative impacts might be . 
I would like to say one more thing . 
In our current policy on EU expansion , we are trying to emphasise the settling of neighbourly relations between the future states on the basis of our European values . 
Ladies and gentlemen , imagine what the reaction of the Union would be if Serbia , for example , decided today to grant citizenship en masse to citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina , or if Albania granted citizenship to citizens of Macedonia . 
I would like to say one more time that only in a situation where there is mutual respect for values and cooperation can we talk about continuing the joint development of the European Union in the future . 
(HU) Madam President , I have asked for the floor three times already and I am glad you managed to give me the floor upon my third request . 
First , I would like to make a correction . 
There was a question about whether the constitution contained that particular fourth-fifths majority or not . 
It was included in the Standing Orders of Parliament , but it was abolished at the proposal of Fidesz . 
What I would like to ask Mr Kukan is that when Mr Markert was here from the Venice Commission and the two-thirds majority was mentioned - which keeps coming up here as well - he confirmed that the two-thirds majority does exist . 
In such cases , self-restraint would be a fundamental expectation , but he can see no sign of it . 
So my question to Mr Kukan is whether he has already discussed with the Fidesz members sitting in the European Parliament the issues he has raised . 
Does he see any signs of willingness to make changes to these points in the constitution ? 
Madam President , is the question for me ? 
My sincere answer is: I cannot answer your question . 
(FR) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the new Hungarian constitution drafted by the Orbán government is not lacking in rather striking articles , as my fellow Members have pointed out . 
The chapter on private life appears to be the high point of a constitution that is based , as we have noted , exclusively on Christian religious references and traditional family values . 
It would appear that this text also allows the right to abortion in Hungary to be restricted by stating , and I quote , ' that the life of the foetus will be protected from the time of conception ' . 
The Hungarian Government has backed up its words by action in this area by launching an anti-abortion communication campaign which would still , apparently , appear to be using funds from the European PROGRESS programme (Community Programme for Employment and Social Solidarity) . 
At a time when the European Union is holding up progress and gender equality as common fundamental values , it is somewhat surprising that these European funds should be involved in a campaign of this nature . 
I should therefore like to take the opportunity of this debate to question the Commission on the validation of the funding for this campaign by the PROGRESS programme . 
(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))
(HU) Mrs Guillaume , I would like to ask you a question . 
In your opinion , how have the regulations concerning the concept of abortion and the rules pertaining to abortion in the new constitution changed compared with the previous constitution ? 
(FR) Madam President , I should like to encourage a response from the Commission about the programme in question . 
I have already put the question to the Commission , and I am awaiting a response to learn whether it has indeed been verified that these funds have indeed been used for this campaign . 
(RO) Madam President , I would like to draw your attention in particular to the provisions of the revised constitution relating to the collective rights of the ethnic Hungarian minority living abroad and to the explicit declaration , in this case , of the principle of extraterritoriality , both of which blatantly breach OSCE standards and the repeated assessments made by the Venice Commission in similar cases . 
I am referring to Article d for Mr Weber ' s benefit . 
This is unacceptable and I should remind you that it is already having an impact . 
Last week , Mr Tőkés , Vice-President of the European Parliament , hosted the official inauguration of an office representing the Székely Region , which does not exist in Romania , in the Hungarian House of Regions . 
I strongly believe , Commissioner , that the Venice Commission ' s report will confirm that these breaches have taken place . 
I would ask you the following then: what will the European Commission want and be able to do about this ? 
Finally , I want to ask the following question , especially to the German and French MEPs among you , here in Strasbourg , which is the symbol of the historical reconciliation between Germany and France , and which our European Union has been built on: can you allow the demons of nationalism to be let loose in Europe without destroying our European Union project ? 
(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))
(HU) Mr Boştinaru , I have two questions that I would like to ask: do Romanian laws allow the granting of citizenship to individuals of Romanian nationality even if they do not live in the territory of Romania ? 
This is my first question . 
My second question is this: is there a law that stipulates that those Romanian citizens who do not live in the territory of Romania can take part in the elections to the National Assembly and the Senate ? 
(RO) Fellow Member , I would like to remind you that I referred solely to European standards and principles which are universally recognised and not to any legal or constitutional provisions in Romania . 
However , I would also like to answer you by saying that there is no legal act in Romania which stipulates the principle of extraterritoriality and collective rights . 
I referred to this when I mentioned the dispute with the European Commission ' s assessments . 
When an infringement of these values is noted in any EU Member State , it is the European Union ' s task to give a robust response , no matter what that state is called . 
This is my answer . 
(IT) Madam President , the new Hungarian constitution limits the possibility of intervention by supervisory bodies such as the constitutional court , and increases the powers of the executive , thereby bringing into question the normal system of checks and balances . 
Social rights have been negated , the state only providing subsidies to the needy if they agree to do community work . 
Finally , the right to self-defence has been sanctioned and weapons may be kept in the home even without a licence . 
The right to abortion has been banned and highly discriminatory laws against homosexuals have been introduced . 
All of this goes against Directive 2000 / 78 / EC , which establishes a general framework for the fight against discrimination . 
I therefore ask the Commissioner what action she intends to take , in view of the fact that the fundamental rights in the new Hungarian constitution are hardly compatible with those of the European Union and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union . 
(NL) Madam President , I am happy to see Commissioner Reding attending this debate on how best to defend European values ​​of democracy . 
We felt her absence during the previous debates on the Hungarian media law , when the same values were at stake . 
As for the constitution , every nation has the right to elect representatives to its own government . 
The government has a responsibility to stand up for the interests of its people , all of its people . 
In the case of Hungary , the majority party , Fidesz , is making the decisions about the content of a new constitution . 
By amending the constitution in that way , without really involving other parties or civil society organisations , it is undermining the democratic process , killing off dynamism and threatening to impose the exclusive right of a single party . 
The majority at the expense of the minority . 
A true democracy is tested and judged on how that country treats its minorities . 
One minority , in particular , the LGBT community , will be especially affected by a constitution which , in the 21st century , is harking back to antiquated ways of life . 
This is going back in time , not moving with the times . 
We expect better of our EU Presidency . 
(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))
(HU) Ladies and gentlemen , I apologise for taking the floor so many times , but I was personally involved in the drafting of this constitution , and I find it greatly disturbing to hear misapprehensions , whether deliberate , or unintentional . 
This is exactly why I would like to ask Mrs Bozkurt the following , after she claimed that there was no consultation on this issue: Did you know that 917 000 Hungarian citizens returned the 12-question questionnaire through which Hungary and the Hungarian Government consulted with its citizens about the important issues in the constitution ? 
Directly with the Hungarian citizens; in fact , 10% of the entire population took part in the consultation . 
Do you happen to know any European constitution that was preceded by consultations on such a wide scale ? 
(NL) Madam President , these things are constantly being played down . 
However , can you explain why there has been so much protest here , why members from all kinds of groups are saying that this is wrong ? 
Why are we having this debate then ? 
I do not think that we would be having this debate if everything had gone well . 
Can you indicate what the party affiliation of the people who sent those 17 000 forms was ? 
Who did you pass them on to ? 
I would like to hear some answers from you about that . 
(HU) Madam President , Mrs Bozkurt , to answer your question , everyone received this letter in which they could express their opinions . 
Thank you for this opportunity for a debate , because this way I can tell you what an immense pleasure the birth of the Hungarian constitution has given me . 
It is a painful fact that the 20 years that have elapsed since the fall of communism were not enough to create a new constitution . 
We have brought this transitional era to a close now and established a new constitution based on national consensus . 
Our new constitution is the collection of our shared values; it starts with our most beautiful national prayer which also emphasises the importance of our common European values , and it finally places the appreciation of our Christian roots and family - our key values - where it belongs . 
It is more than reassuring that in the new constitution , the Hungarian state takes responsibility for its citizens both within and outside its borders , does not allow state debt to run out of control , and , among other things , it declares parents ' responsibility for their children . 
(HU) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I am pleased to take the floor at the end of the debate , because sadly , I have to say that at the end of the day , I have not heard any specific criticisms from you . 
Secondly , we , MEPs , cannot have a say in a matter of national competence . 
However , now that I was given the floor , I would rather not criticise , but make a recommendation on behalf of 80 million people living with disabilities . 
The Hungarian constitution is the only European constitution that includes special provisions and assistance for people with disabilities . 
So I would suggest you include similar provisions in your respective countries ' constitution . 
Thank you for your attention . 
(SK) Madam President , the unprecedented declaration by the second highest representative of the Hungarian Republic , the Speaker of Parliament , Mr Kövér , who has called the Paris Treaty and the borders into question , only confirms the level of revisionism being applied under the Hungarian policy . 
It is unfortunate that the government of Iveta Radičová in Slovakia , under the pretext of non-confrontationalism , is concealing its own inability to respond to dual citizenship , to the constitution of the Hungarian Republic , to voting rights for Hungarians living in neighbouring countries and to the statements of the Speaker of the Hungarian Parliament . 
I am concerned about the ineptitude of our government , but the silence of the European institutions is also striking , as if they did not want to see this violation of European law by the country holding the Presidency . 
I hope that the representatives of the European institutions will listen carefully and monitor the situation in Hungary , and that they will make an uncompromising statement very soon on the undermining of the borders and the Paris Peace Treaty , and on a Hungarian constitution which enshrines support for the collective rights of Hungarian minorities and the creation of collective self-governing areas . 
(HU) Madam President , Commissioner Reding , I am addressing you . 
It is obvious that the Hungarian constitution in itself would not have generated such a wide European debate , but unfortunately , Hungary is back on the agenda again after six months , when we looked at the media law . 
In fact , it is not the constitution itself , but the anti-democratic practices that have taken root in Hungary: judges , policemen , and people paying into private pension funds are deprived of their acquired rights . 
Commissioner , what is the underlying reason for divesting the constitutional court and the ombudsmen of their acquired rights ? 
They are threatening the independence of the courts; they have already snatched the independence of the media . 
These are all extremely important and extremely dangerous elements . 
Commissioner , I would like to hand over to you the 30-page criticism of the Venice Commission . 
This body formulated extremely serious criticisms and I really hope that the European Commission and you in particular , will finally take its duty seriously , because you should be the guardian of the European Treaties . 
Please , do your job ! 
(SL) Madam President , the Hungarian Presidency surprised us at the very beginning with an unusual gift , a map of Greater Hungary , a map of a dream which can obviously only become a reality in a united , democratic Europe , and which does not invoke the past . 
Today ' s debate is evidence that nationalism , and excessive nationalism at that , is one of the causes of division . 
In the region that I come from , we have had a great many problems in recent decades because of nationalism . 
I ask the Hungarian members of Parliament and the representatives of Hungarian authorities to abandon nationalistic games and playing around with peace treaties which remain unrealised and which they perceive as unjust . 
Otherwise , the Treaty of Trianon will come to represent for all of us something that is not good . 
Madam President , I would just like to ask for a little clarification from colleagues on that side of the House , because in the debate , you have firmly insisted on the right of every Member State to pass laws as it deems fit , as long as it has a democratic majority , and that those laws should be recognised by other countries . 
Could I perhaps ask Mr Szájer to reply , on behalf of the EPP Group , whether that means that , from now on , Hungary and the other countries represented will also recognise the Dutch marriage law that allows same-sex couples to get married ? 
(PL) Madam President , this debate reminds me of another debate , held several months ago , on the media laws in Hungary . 
Both that debate and this one are merely a pretext for attacking Hungary . 
European political correctness cannot bear the fact that there is a country in which conservatism is triumphing , that there is a country in Europe where national interests are being effectively protected , and that there is a country in Europe which is returning to real values . 
This is an attack on the Hungarian Government for having successfully rescued the country after half a century of bankrupt Communist governments and their political offspring . 
Now it is the turn of the constitution . 
While European political correctness is forcefully dissociating itself from its Christian roots , the Hungarians have dared to take pride in enshrining them in their constitution . 
While Brussels is promoting cosmopolitanism , Budapest is emphasising its heroic national past . 
Hungarians are focusing on national identity , their own state and common sense . 
The world is finally back to rights . 
Communism is described as a tyrant , and marriage is at last a union between a woman and a man . 
I hope that future generations of Hungarians will be proud of this fine constitution . 
(HU) Madam President , in today ' s debate , it seems that the Venice Commission has become a kind of European super Supreme Court . 
The same Venice Commission formulated serious criticisms , justified criticisms against the Slovak language law that is still in force , and I have not heard any of my fellow Slovak Members ever refer to that language law . 
My fellow Member , Mr Boştinaru is not in the Chamber anymore , so he cannot reply , but I would like to answer Mr Szájer that I , as a Romanian citizen , do know that Romanian citizens living outside the territory of Romania can vote and can have passports , and , similarly to the Slovak constitution , many European constitutions lay down the rights of their citizens living outside their borders . 
I do not see anything objectionable in this . 
What I would rather contemplate is why Hungary feels the need to include this in the constitution - it is because Hungarians living outside the borders are still discriminated in countries where the Hungarian constitution is vehemently criticised . 
Madam President , I think I put a very concrete and clear question to Mr Szájer . 
I hope he would like to reply . 
We are using the catch-the-eye procedure , so the blue-card procedure is not permitted . 
(HU) Madam President , as a Slovakian citizen , I would like to express my opinion on what is happening here today . 
I belong to those who were not given mass Hungarian citizenship , because this will be granted to those who lodged their application individually . 
The reason why I asked to take the floor is the belligerent tone that some colleagues have adopted . 
I am extremely worried about the fact that the Hungarian constitution is assessed as if it were an attack against peaceful cohabitation in Europe . 
I feel that because of completely misinterpreted or poorly translated texts - for example , the right to vote , which is not included in the constitution - we are having these speeches made in an extremely bad mood and striking a very belligerent tone , which are not appropriate in the European Parliament . 
(HU) Madam President , the Socialist initiative can be described as having three main characteristics: it breaks the law , it is cowardly , and bears the characteristics of show trials . 
It breaks the law because the European Parliament has no licence or competence whatsoever to examine the Hungarian constitution . 
It is clear from the letter of Mr Barroso and the statement of Mrs Reding that this is within national sovereignty . 
It is cowardly because if the Socialists had found anything to contest , they would have turned to the European Court in Luxembourg and would not be debating here . 
They have not done so , because they know exactly that they would lose the Court case . 
And finally , both the procedure and the initiative bear the characteristics of show trials because there is only one thing in the background: Fidesz winning the elections by a two-thirds majority last year . 
The Socialists - apparently not only the Hungarian , but also the European Socialists - have not been able to swallow the decision of the Hungarian citizens , so they take every opportunity to attack the Hungarian Government . 
(PL) Madam President , it has to be said that the hypocrisy and double standards in this debate and in the criticism of the Hungarian constitution are striking . 
On the one hand , accusations have been levelled at the constitution because it does not refer to God and Christianity , and because it offers no protection for what are known as homosexual marriages . 
Yet such accusations could easily be made regarding a great many European constitutions , including the Polish constitution , for example , which also contains such provisions , or does not contain them in the latter case . 
This is exactly as it should be , for this is a domestic matter for Poland to deal with , as laid down in the EU Treaty . 
We should not violate our own Treaty on European Union . 
The drafting of the constitution has been accused of being undemocratic , yet people are ignoring the fact that the vast majority of Hungarians supported this constitution . 
This hypocrisy is also apparent from the way in which those protesting so loudly today against Hungary and its Prime Minister , Mr Orbán , were silent when the previous socialist government in Hungary in practice brought its country to the brink of bankruptcy , using force to silence the opposition when it protested at democratic rallies and gatherings . 
This is not a matter in which we should get involved . 
(HU) Mr János Áder , just a ten-second correction of what you have just said . 
The European Court of Human Rights is not in Luxembourg . 
It is located in Strasbourg . 
(DE) Madam President , Mrs Győri , Mrs Reding , I fail to see the point of this debate . 
I would have framed some of the points in the Hungarian constitution differently . 
There are also some points in my own German constitution that I do not fully agree with , likewise the French constitution . 
However , this has nothing to do with this House , because it is not responsible for such issues . 
That is the crucial point . 
That is , unless is it specifically established that some provision is in breach of European law . 
If someone does not like a particular element in a national constitution , this has nothing to do with this House , because this is a matter of national identity and jurisdiction . 
Just as the Commission forced changes in Hungary ' s media laws because some points were unacceptable , so it or the European Court of Justice will take action if laws are passed when implementing the constitution that breach European law . 
It is even possible to take a case to the European Court of Justice . 
It is for this reason that I believe what we are witnessing here is a bit of political theatre . 
We do not have the right to interfere with the Hungarian constitution . 
Perhaps I would have done certain things differently , but it is Hungary ' s right to do things as it sees fit . 
(HU) Madam President , we have witnessed an unprecedented event here , in the European Parliament . 
The constitution of a Member State , one of the most important components of national sovereignty , has been attacked here by certain MEPs . 
You had better be aware that those who have blatantly infringed national sovereignty not only cause damage to Hungary , but to all of Europe . 
This case established a precedent that weakens genuine supporters of Europe and strengthens Eurosceptics . 
This is irresponsible behaviour . 
At the same time , what we have heard from the Commission is reassuring . 
It seemed to be self-evident , yet I am happy that the point was made at this plenary session . 
The European Commission has no intentions or right to interfere with the constitutional affairs of Member States . 
After all this , it is high time the left wing stops its provocative political campaign based on misrepresentations against the Hungarian Government . 
The new Hungarian constitution is an important instrument for clearing away the ruins left by eight years of corrupt and inept Socialist governance . 
Fidesz was given a two-thirds majority mandate to do this job . 
The left wing simply has to accept that this decision cannot be changed either in Brussels , or in Strasbourg . 
(DE) Madam President , Mr Brok , I found your remarks somewhat irritating , which is why I asked to speak . 
Naturally , the European Union has competences that enable it to establish the compatibility of national law with European law . 
As you said yourself , anything that breaches the European Treaties can also be clarified in a court of law . 
So , why should this House be prevented from debating such a situation ? 
Is it not , in fact , absolutely necessary for this House to debate this issue ? 
I believe that we are witnessing a trend whereby national constitutions are seen as an area where there is no room for political debate among European democracies . 
If we live in a European democracy , then of course , the core components of our constitutions must be mutually agreed and must be compatible with the international treaties that we have all signed . 
These include , for example , the Convention on Human Rights , as well as the Treaties of the European Union , and I believe that we should be able to debate this issue in this Chamber . 
Vice-President of the Commission . - Madam President , I had asked to have a clear line from the European Parliament . 
Well , there was no clear line from the European Parliament . 
I heard a lot of diverging opinions , which in itself shows how complex this matter is . 
So let me underline once more that the Commission respects the Lisbon Treaty and does not intervene in the sovereignty of nation states . 
On behalf of President Barroso , I would like to underline once more that the Commission does not make political judgments on the fundamental constitutional and institutional choices that a Member State makes . 
The adoption of a new constitution in a Member State is a matter for its people and for its institutions . 
As I have already underlined , we could become competent when the constitution is translated into legislative , administrative or judicial practice . 
I can assure Parliament that we would not hesitate for a moment to intervene in such a case if the Treaty or the Charter was violated or if Union law was not respected . 
Turning to Ms Guillaume ' s question on Union law: when Union law is at stake , I have never shied away from action . 
The question raised by Ms Guillaume concerns an awareness-raising campaign on the work-life balance , which was supported by the Progress programme . 
This is part of the campaign consisting of promotion material showing a foetus with the words ' Let me live ' , with the Commission ' s logo . 
I made it very clear: this campaign is not in line with the Progress programme and it is not in line with the project proposal submitted to the Commission services by the Hungarian authorities . 
Therefore , the Commission asked for this part of the campaign to be stopped without further delay and for all existing posters to be removed . 
If this is not done , we will start procedures to terminate the ground agreement and draw necessary consequences , including financial ones . 
That is how we answer when European law is at stake . 
Constitutions are not within our competence . 
President-in-Office of the Council . - Madam President , first of all , I would like to thank this House for the particular attention it has paid to my government ' s activities in the last semester . 
The Hungarian Presidency is strongly convinced that the newly adopted - not revised - Hungarian constitution is fully in line with the basic values and principles on which the Union is founded . 
Since the beginning of our Presidency , we have dedicated all our energy and have been tireless in our efforts in promoting the common European agenda . 
I am especially pleased that not even the critics , who were mentioned during today ' s debate , have questioned the firmness and the sincerity of my government ' s commitment . 
Madam President , on a point of order - and I tried to make this point halfway through the debate , but you cut me off - I would suggest that you look back over this debate and see how you allocated blue card questions and catch-the-eye requests . 
I can sum it up: two blue card requests from me were ignored , while requests were approved from Mr Alvaro (twice) , from Ms Göncz (three times) and from Mr Tavares (once) . 
You were unable to genuinely balance the way these were distributed . 
I would ask you to take a look at this next time so as to achieve a balance . 
I assure you , Mrs Sargentini , we have gone over the allotted time of 45 minutes . 
All the Members have had an opportunity to speak . 
I allowed them to speak for at least 15 seconds and even a minute in some cases , and the balance between the political groups has been fully respected . 
However , you are entitled to check and , of course , to make a complaint . 
The debate is closed . 
Written statements (Rule 149)
The Hungarian constitution was adopted on 18 April using a process which has pushed democracy to its limits . 
It will come into force early next year . 
Although we do not have the necessary powers to dictate to one Member State what the content of its fundamental law should be , we cannot act with indifference to this anti-democratic abuse . 
This is a case which must sound a warning bell for all Member States and governments , regardless of their political persuasion . 
What is even more serious is that the Hungarian Government is using the EU Presidency not to contribute to the construction of a united Europe , but to support the resurgence of a nationalism which we thought had been forgotten . 
As far as states like Romania and Slovakia are concerned , the content of the constitution may create a framework conducive to dangerous situations , based on collective rights for ethnic Hungarians and the principle of extraterritoriality . 
Furthermore , the Hungarian Government has shown its support for setting up an office for the Székely Region in Brussels , which is a major affront to Romanians and Romania ' s territorial integrity . 
I believe that the European Parliament has the right to discuss the legislative solutions enshrined in the constitutions of its Member States . 
We live in one Europe , and the citizens of our countries have a right to live in any Member State without any barriers . 
However , we must remember that the European nations have a sovereign right to enact fundamental laws . 
Different countries and different nationalities have been shaped by different experiences . 
Hungarians also have the right to adopt a constitution which makes no mention of an ombudsman or a personal data representative . 
When I hear MEPs talking about the Hungarian Parliament violating fundamental European principles , I cannot help but feel that I do not share the principles to which you refer . 
Most of all , I would like to congratulate Hungary on its new constitution . 
The fact that the overwhelming majority of Hungarians support the new legislation is particularly impressive , and proves that the Hungarian nation has moved completely away from the tradition of Communist constitutions , within which the previous constitution had been drafted . 
Hungary is a Member State of the European Union , and follows the rules of the club correctly . 
In case someone thinks otherwise , the club has corresponding rules on how to proceed . 
If they happen to be right , then please lodge an action for breach of duty against us . 
This is the procedure in the case of every other country as well , and we , Hungarians , do not request to be exempted from this procedure . 
We defend our point of view in a fair debate that is based on truth , but we do not wish to take part in a political witch hunt . 
Whilst clearing away the ruins left by your Hungarian Socialist colleagues , we are mobilising tremendous energies to make Hungary a democratic , European , and free country based on the constitutional mandate we received from the Hungarian citizens in free elections . 
This is the reason why we adopted the new constitution that will finally replace the communist constitution of 1949 , which evoked bad memories and was the symbol of tyranny for Hungarians . 
We are a nation that loves freedom and democracy . 
Our constitution , which has protected the right to resist tyranny since the famous Golden Bull , the Hungarian Magna Carta of 1222 , included religious tolerance by virtue of the Declaration of Torda for the first time in Europe , was among the first to guarantee equality before law in 1848 , and has one of the oldest parliamentary traditions in Europe , is a thousand years old . 
We do not need to be lectured about democracy by those who have plenty of homework to do in their own countries . 
The European Union is built on fundamental principles such as the equality between men and women . 
However , by approving a new constitution that states that the foetus must be protected from the moment of conception , Hungary , a Member State , has trampled on these values by allowing the right to abortion once more to be brought into question . 
I have also learnt that the Hungarian Government has launched a publicity campaign against the right to abortion , funded , and therefore apparently sanctioned , by the European Union . 
I would like to draw attention at this point to the fact that the right to abortion is a fundamental right for which thousands of women have fought and continue to fight in Europe , often at the risk of their lives , that it is supported by this Parliament and by the Hungarian citizens , and that it is recognised by 23 Member States out of 27 . 
In addition to disassociating itself from a policy of this nature that goes against the fundamental rights of women , the European Commission must do its utmost to ensure that the Hungarian Government puts a stop to all campaigns seeking to call into question the right to abortion . 
This is an issue of protecting our common values . 
European Arrest Warrant (debate)
The next item is the oral questions to the Council and the Commission on the European Arrest Warrant . 
author . - (DE) Madam President , today we find ourselves debating the issue of the European Arrest Warrant . 
It is high time that this discussion was brought to the table . 
We have submitted a question through the groups tabling a debate on the reform of the European Arrest Warrant and its application , and are asking the Commission and Council to respond with proposals . 
The European Arrest Warrant was trumpeted as the perfect example of mutual recognition in the area of justice and policing . 
When the European Arrest Warrant was passed as a framework decision , the European Parliament always made it perfectly clear that , on the one hand , the conditions for applying the European Arrest Warrant are relatively strict , so that it should apply only to really serious crimes , that it should be applied in a proportionate way , and that the procedural standards in the European Union should be harmonised at the same time . 
None of these requirements has really been met in full . 
In many specific cases , the Arrest Warrant is not applied in a proportionate way , as we can see in the reports now available to us . 
Thus , we need to adjust procedures , both in practice and in legislation . 
Thanks to the work of Vice-President Reding , after ten years , we are finally making progress in harmonising procedural standards . 
However , it is essential that we should make numerous further advances , including in relation to the conditions under which prisoners are held and the question of individual standards of legal protection . 
In future , our sole concern should not just be the cooperation between the police and judicial authorities as regards mutual recognition; we must also look at the establishment of procedural standards . 
Nonetheless , the European Arrest Warrant must be amended today , as its application is obviously incompatible with the standards we have called for , particularly in terms of the checking of proportionality in individual cases . 
Madam President , the European Arrest Warrant has proved to be a very useful instrument in seeking justice beyond national borders . 
It has helped us open up national borders by sending a clear message to criminals that they may no longer flee to another country to avoid prosecution . 
It is therefore important that the European Arrest Warrant is seen as a useful instrument that has reaped good results . 
However , it also has its downsides , such as when it is issued for crimes which are considered too minor for its justification . 
I do not expect a European Arrest Warrant to be issued because someone is caught stealing two car tyres in another country , as has happened in the past . 
The punishment does not fit the crime and leads to a lack of trust in an important and useful instrument . 
Therefore , we need to look at the defects in the system and in its application , without destroying the usefulness of this warrant . 
It is for this reason that we are putting forward this Parliamentary question to the Commission to help us understand how the warrant was put into use these past few years . 
Such information will help us decide whether we need to update it so as to safeguard its correct application . 
author . - Madam President , the Liberal Group in the European Parliament has always been supportive of the European Arrest Warrant because of its importance in the fight against serious cross-border crime . 
However , simultaneously , my group has always pointed out that the European Arrest Warrant system would be incomplete without advancing procedural defence rights in Europe . 
We have constantly criticised the Council for not progressing that agenda on the basis of the Commission ' s comprehensive proposal . 
Now we are finally changing the situation on defence rights , and I applaud Vice-President Reding for her commitment to this programme under the road map . 
The question is: will this be enough to compensate for the failings of the European Arrest Warrant ? 
I think not . 
We also have to do something about the way the European Arrest Warrant system operates . 
However , let us just note the successes: between 2005 and 2009 , the arrest warrant has secured the extradition of almost 12 000 drug smugglers , child sex offenders , rapists and others . 
They include Hussain Osman , one of the 2005 London bombers . 
No Londoner could be ungrateful to the European Arrest Warrant in the light of that . 
He came back within six weeks , from Italy . 
However , in the UK at least , and we will hear this later , the European Arrest Warrant has become a favourite stick with which the Eurosceptics batter the reputation of the EU . 
Their cause has been helped by several notorious cases of breaches of human rights . 
In fact , the UK receives the second highest number of requests for surrender after Germany . 
Both the Commission and defence rights organisations like Fair Trials International - I declare an interest , I am a patron - and Justice , on whose council I sit , have pinpointed failings in the arrest warrant . 
Problems with it being used for minor offences , the lack of legal representation in the issuing state , long pre-trial detention periods , the lack of bail for people who are not nationals of the issuing state , and bad detention conditions are all cited with reason . 
The Commission does not think that we need to recast the European Arrest Warrant . 
I think we need to reconsider that . 
Firstly , we need to have a much sounder basis for the requirement for a proportionality check , so that minor offences are not covered . 
Secondly , we need to have an explicit human rights check in the executing state . 
That needs to be made explicit , and not implicit . 
Thirdly , it needs to be recognised when it is not reasonable to execute a European Arrest Warrant , so that someone is not followed by alerts in the Schengen Information System around Europe even though their surrender has been refused once on valid grounds . 
We also need to do something about the bail situation , not least by implementing the framework decision on supervision orders . 
There do need to be changes to the European Arrest Warrant , but fundamentally it has been a success . 
Those who question it need to ask themselves whether they would be satisfied with criminals spending years beyond the reach of the courts and beyond the reach of justice , because traditional extradition takes too long and has too much red tape . 
author . - (DE) Madam President , in the debate on the Hungarian constitution , we heard more than once the criticism that it was a political debate . 
I am completely taken aback by that , because having political debates is one of the things that Parliament is expressly there to do; and I therefore want to start this topic by setting out the political framework too . 
Crime , and organised crime in particular , has never been held back by borders or border controls . 
It therefore makes no sense to rebuild borders in Europe and to restrict the way our populations are growing together . 
On the contrary: what we need is the consistent further development of cooperation between our Member States and cross-border cooperation by the police and justice authorities . 
In this area , the European Arrest Warrant has repeatedly proven itself to be an important and successful instrument . 
At the same time , however , this instrument will fall into disrepute if European Arrest Warrants are used for , say , stolen bicycles , or merely in order to carry out questioning . 
I regret to say that we have also found that it is being used when perhaps it has been decided not to execute an arrest warrant because there is evidence to show that it was unjustly issued and this is then not respected by the issuing Member State - resulting in the unfortunate situation in which the citizens concerned are repeatedly arrested whenever they cross a border . 
That does nothing to help build confidence in European legal systems . 
Why is this happening ? 
Does the text of the directive leave too much leeway ? 
Is it a matter of incorrect implementation in the Member States or inadequate information ? 
We need to clarify these points , the Member States need to make improvements where necessary , and the Commission must take action to prevent such misuse . 
That is the only way to prevent a successful instrument being permanently damaged and confidence in these measures being lost . 
Moreover , all these experiences show how important it is that we finally make some progress on the road map for procedural rights . 
In the interests of legal certainty for everyone involved , we need to have the same rights across Europe for those accused of offences and there must be mandatory information on these rights . 
I call on the Commission to exert pressure to counter possible opposition on all these points; I am sure it can count on the support of Parliament in this . 
(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))
Madam President , Ms Sippel described the European Arrest Warrant as a baby . 
Is it not in fact much more of a Frankenstein ' s monster ? 
Should she not accept that ? 
author . - (DE) I am not sure whether I should answer your question , as it is more of a polemic comment . 
However , the figures show that the European Arrest Warrant is an appropriate instrument for fighting crime in the unified space of Europe . 
Crime is not national; crime is international and crosses borders . 
That is why we need to cooperate across borders . 
We need to deal with the teething problems of the European Arrest Warrant and stop it being misused . 
As an instrument , however , it is indispensable . 
author . - Madam President , since 2004 , I have warned that the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) could be used as an instrument of oppression against political dissidents . 
This is what is happening now in the case of Julian Assange . 
There are many irregularities in the Swedish case against him . 
Mr Assange has not yet been charged with any specific offence . 
A previous investigation against him , for what the Swedes designate as ' minor rape ' , was dropped by a senior prosecutor in Stockholm almost four months before the EAW was issued . 
The reinstated investigation leading to the EAW saw a failure of the prosecutor to interview witnesses that could clear Mr Assange . 
Independent legal opinion in England has said that the allegations against Mr Assange would not constitute rape under English law . 
The complainant ' s lawyer in Sweden has reportedly stated that the ladies themselves cannot tell if the acts in question constituted rapes , because they are not lawyers . 
Nevertheless , the tick box on the EAW marked rape contains no definition or explanation of what constitutes the crime . 
Mr Assange remained in Sweden for five weeks to answer the allegations , but he was not questioned as the investigation was unduly delayed . 
Mr Assange arrived in Sweden less than a month after WikiLeaks leaked the Afghanistan war logs and announced it had many more revelations to come . 
Senior figures in the USA have called for Mr Assange to be assassinated or kidnapped , and for the US Government to act as if it were at war with WikiLeaks , which they describe as a terrorist organisation . 
All this coincides with the convenient issuing of a European Arrest Warrant against him . 
Sweden has a close relationship with the USA in terms of intelligence sharing and cooperation , calling into question Sweden ' s perceived neutrality . 
Why would the USA want Mr Assange to be extradited to Sweden ? 
The Americans are still building a case against him and do not know what they can charge him with , if anything . 
Without a charge , the USA cannot extradite him from the UK , but they need him locked up somewhere while they work it out , preventing him from returning to Australia . 
The European Arrest Warrant offers the perfect expedient . 
As I have said many times in this Chamber , under the European Arrest Warrant , extradition - or rather judicial surrender , to use the correct term - is now merely a bureaucratic formality . 
There are simply no real safeguards . 
Having said all that , my question to the Council and the Commission is not: is the EAW being abused for political purposes ? 
It is: can it be abused ? 
If the Council and Commission are honest , they will have to admit that it can . 
Will they please do so now ? 
In my opinion , the evidence shows that it is most certainly happening in the case of Julian Assange . 
Madam President , the text of the oral questions might seem abstract and theoretical , but the European Arrest Warrant nevertheless concerns the fates of individuals , human rights and fundamental freedoms . 
In the Netherlands , much attention has been focused on the fate of Cor Disselkoen . 
In 1997 , this Dutch entrepreneur was charged with breaching the Polish taxation rules . 
He spent two months in prison for this , in appalling conditions . 
Having paid a very large amount of money as bail , he was released and for twelve years he heard nothing more about this case . 
However , last year , Poland suddenly demanded this entrepreneur ' s extradition . 
On this occasion , Poland made use of the European Arrest Warrant . 
Ten days ago , he was transferred to Poland . 
Mr Disselkoen ' s lawyer says he was held there in a prison which was just as filthy and overcrowded as the one in which he was held in 1997 . 
Contrary to all the rules , the consultation between Disselkoen and his lawyer was recorded with a video camera . 
In addition , four new charges were suddenly added to his sheet . 
The judge even insinuated that these could lead to a new arrest warrant . 
Disselkoen has once again paid a large amount of money as bail and is back in the Netherlands , but his case shows that the European Arrest Warrant may lead to degrading situations . 
In its report , the Commission has demonstrated that it is aware of the problems and that it is concerned about them . 
That is why my group is pinning its hopes on the Commissioner . 
Commissioner , can you personally offer any explanation of how the proportionality requirements should be interpreted and arrange for this to be taken over by the Council ? 
Can you make sure that people will actually be entitled to challenge an arrest warrant in both the Member State which has issued the warrant and the Member State which is carrying it out ? 
Do you agree that it ought to be possible to consistently refuse to carry out arrest warrants on behalf of countries where conditions in prisons and houses of detention remain inhumane , that the EAW will be subjected to a human rights assessment and that Cor Disselkoen need not fear even more misery ? 
author . - Madam President , no one can deny the positive impact the European Arrest Warrant has had on cross-border crime . 
It has so far contributed to the extradition of almost 12 000 drug smugglers , child sex offenders , rapists and terrorists , and has avoided lengthy extradition procedures in the process . 
The speed of this tool has been invaluable , given the freedom to cross borders and increases in cross-border crime . 
However , what this tool was never intended for was to investigate and punish petty crimes such as the theft of a pig , stealing a chocolate bar or exceeding a bank overdraft limit . 
What you see today is a rare occurrence here . 
Nearly all political groups and all nationalities collected here are saying that now is the time to review , re-evaluate and , if necessary , amend . 
Proportionality , protection and redress are the key to reforming this tool . 
We are now currently working on the European Investigation Order , a partner to the European Arrest Warrant . 
It is essential that we do not make the same mistakes again . 
We must draft this new legislation with a clear working memory as to the flaws and obstacles of the European Arrest Warrant . 
There have been simply too many examples of substandard conditions for prisoners , too many misplaced warrants and too great a lack of redress for those who have been victims of errors . 
I fear that we are moving forwards with the EIO whilst its very foundations , and the European Arrest Warrant on which it is based , are decidedly shaky . 
We need to rebuild the trust in , and value of , this tool and reserve it for only the most serious of crimes , whilst guaranteeing and maintaining the highest of standards in its use . 
(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))
Madam President , I would like to ask Mr Kirkhope this question because he agrees that the European Arrest Warrant needs review and re-evaluation - my view would be a lot stronger than that , but never mind . 
He mentioned the European Investigation Order and I believe he was saying that this could be a step too far . 
But is he aware that , in his own government , one of the first acts of the Home Secretary , Theresa May , when coming into office was to opt into the European Investigation Order , which means we now cannot opt out and will be stuck with whatever comes through the legislative sausage machine , because this will be subject to qualified majority voting and the final outcome is something we cannot determine ? 
Is this another case of Tory double-speak , where they speak out against the acts of the European Union here but endorse them back home in our own parliament ? 
Mr President , the position regarding the UK Government with regard to both the European Arrest Warrant and the European Investigation Order is that clearly they feel they have an obligation - quite rightly - to do what is best for the UK in relation to cross-border crime . 
We have been the victims of an enormous amount of crime , and terrorism in particular , as the honourable gentleman is aware . 
I am sure that he would share with me our determination to stamp out this crime , and working together across borders is the best way to achieve it . 
Of course , the European Investigation Order needs careful implementation . 
But merely opting into it and to the concept of it , as has been done by the government , is not , of course , the final shout . 
What we need to see here is the detail of this order; we need to implement it effectively and make it work well alongside the Arrest Warrant . 
But the fact that we have opted in is a good indication that we are determined to deal with cross-border crime . 
I trust the honourable gentleman shares our wishes in that regard . 
President-in-Office of the Council . - Madam President , the European Arrest Warrant has become one of the most successful instruments on mutual recognition adopted within the European Union . 
Therefore , I am very thankful to you for having initiated this debate . 
The Council has devoted a great deal of attention and energy to this issue , not least through a mutual peer evaluation of the practical application of this instrument which has been carried out in all Member States over a period of three years . 
The advantages of the European Arrest Warrant by far outweigh any possible inconveniences . 
Thanks to the EAW , the Union has managed to reduce surrender times considerably , in many cases from one or two years to only one or two months . 
The previous extradition system was cumbersome and no longer fit for purpose in the modern world of open borders and serious and organised cross-border crimes . 
On the issue of proportionality , whilst there have been some cases of minor importance for which a European Arrest Warrant was issued , it is ultimately a matter for the issuing authority in each Member State to decide for which offences it wants to launch the proceedings . 
This is a result of the fact that , unlike extradition , the European Arrest Warrant is a fully judicial system . 
A European Arrest Warrant is always based on a judicial decision in the issuing state and the decision on whether or not to issue an EAW is for the national judicial authority . 
If there is a proportionality problem , it is not caused by the instrument or by the EAW framework decision; it is rather the result of the criminal justice policies in individual Member States . 
The Council has been quite clear that in cases where preventive detention is inappropriate , the European Arrest Warrant should not be used . 
The Council has also called on the instrument ' s practitioners to consider and seek advice on the use of alternatives to the European Arrest Warrant . 
Taking into account the overall efficiency of criminal proceedings , these alternatives could include using the less coercive instruments of mutual legal assistance where possible , using video-conferencing for suspects , convoking someone for appearance before a judge by means of a summons , using the Schengen Information System to establish the place of residence of a suspect , or the use of the framework decision on the mutual recognition of financial penalties . 
However , such assessments should always be made by the issuing authority . 
The European Arrest Warrants are issued in relation to prosecutions or final convictions in the issuing state . 
These judicial decisions are based on the material available to the judge or prosecutor in the issuing state . 
Furthermore , we should not ignore the victims . 
In most cases , the victims of the offence are in the issuing state , not in the executing state , so by delaying the trial and examination of the case , the rights of victims are also being undermined . 
Justice delayed is justice denied , not only for suspects but also for victims . 
It is also in the interest of the victims to have a speedy trial so that their rights are respected . 
The Council intends to adopt a road map proposed by the Hungarian Presidency to strengthen these rights . 
The solution to the proportionality principle cannot therefore be that we change the fundamentals of the well-functioning European Arrest Warrant system , which has radically improved the prior extradition system . 
Regarding the rights of the defence , I would like first to remark that , unlike extradition , the European Arrest Warrant is a fully judicial system which , in itself , is already a major guarantee . 
A European Arrest Warrant is always based on a judicial decision in the issuing state and can be executed in the executing state only through a judicial decision . 
The person will always be able to fully exercise his defence rights in the issuing Member State where the trial on the merits of the case takes place . 
This is fully in compliance with the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg . 
That does not imply that the person against whom a European Arrest Warrant has been issued is not , and should not , be able to exercise any rights in the executing state . 
Directive 2010 / 64 of 20 October 2010 provides for the right to interpretation and translation in criminal proceedings and also applies in the execution of the European Arrest Warrant . 
Furthermore , we welcome the fact that a recent Commission proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the right to information in criminal proceedings provides for the right to written information in European Arrest Warrant proceedings . 
Concerns have been expressed that a negative decision on a European Arrest Warrant does not automatically lead to a deletion of the corresponding alert in the Schengen Information System . 
However , the SIS alert is a means of transmission of the European Arrest Warrant . 
Ultimately , it is only the issuing authority that has entered an alert that can withdraw it . 
In cases where a Member State refuses , following judicial proceedings , to execute a European Arrest Warrant , the person in question will be released . 
If the refusal to execute the European Arrest Warrant is final , it is clear that the person can no longer be arrested in that Member State as a result of the instrument . 
However , any refusal to execute a European Arrest Warrant does not invalidate it . 
It remains a valid title for the arrest of the person concerned in the issuing Member State and indeed in any other Member State . 
This has nothing to do with the European Arrest Warrant system as such and is , for example , also the case under the extradition system . 
Finally , regarding prison conditions , these may , of course , be open to improvement in some cases , but this is not a topic which is specific to the implementation of the European Arrest Warrant . 
It is the responsibility of the authorities of individual Member States to ensure that prison conditions are up to standard , regardless of whether persons have been surrendered from other Member States or not . 
Mr President , in my view , the arrest warrant is a fundamental tool in the fight against organised crime , terrorism and other forms of crime . 
It is a proven tool and , according to the Decision , the cornerstone of cooperation and the first concrete example of the principal of mutual recognition in the sphere of criminal law . 
Of course it is a very useful tool but we must not fail to mention that it also has weaknesses . 
The weaknesses are perfectly identified , as Commissioner Reding has also said , not only in the Commission ' s report of April 2011 , but also in its reports of 2005 and 2006 . 
Those weaknesses , which stem fundamentally from two basic and essential premises , can and , naturally , must be corrected . 
The arrest warrant has two components: issue and refusal or surrender , as appropriate . 
The figures show that it is a useful tool , with 54 000 arrest warrants having been issued and 12 000 executed . 
Turning to the question of what corrections need to be made , what we need are greater and better procedural guarantees around issue , refusal and surrender . 
The issue of proportionality or the lack thereof in the use of the arrest warrant is critical , a key issue . 
For that reason , it gives me great pleasure to hear Commissioner Reding say that Member States will be required to exercise a proportionality test and to take care not to issue arrest warrants for minor offences . 
Incidentally , Mr President , during the course of these questions , one particular item has slipped in , namely , that every arrest warrant costs the Public Treasury EUR 25 000 . 
This is something that was said by an Irish judge . 
I say to that judge that I do not believe it and that he should demonstrate on what basis such a calculation was made . 
Consequently , I believe that the arrest warrant should continue in force in revitalised form , with better procedural guarantees . 
(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))
Mr President , is Mr Díaz de Mera aware that a fast-track extradition treaty was signed between the UK and Spain in 2003 , long before the European Arrest Warrant , and would the speaker perhaps consider that this is a better blueprint for dealing with serious crime , rather than the European Arrest Warrant with all the problems of which we are now hearing ? 
(ES) No , Mr Dartmouth . 
I believe that the European Arrest Warrant is a more useful and more versatile tool for combating all the forms of crime to which we have referred . 
Commissioner Reding has already told you , and I emphasise the fact , that an extradition order can take up to a year whereas a European Arrest Warrant , on the other hand , must be substantiated within 40 days . 
That is why I believe that the latter is a much more versatile and much more useful procedure for fighting crime , wrongdoing and terrorism . 
on behalf of the S&D Group . - Mr President , the situation for our group is very clear . 
We heard on the one hand from the Council that , if a European Arrest Warrant is executed properly and effectively and not in the many trivial cases we have seen , its advantages outweigh those disadvantages . 
The Commissioner set out what is a credible report - a serious report - which tells us that if we can deal with trivial cases and disproportionality and with the procedural guarantees , then the European Arrest Warrant can still be a valuable way of catching serious , organised criminals . 
We should not forget the 12 000 figure - I feel very strongly about the fact that in my constituency of London , we caught the attempted bombers of July 2005 . 
When we understand the serious and symbolic effect of these cases , the European Arrest Warrant can and should work . 
The oral question we have today for our group is very simple . 
We are now in the area of moving from the reports to the action , and we have a situation where we have two hard cases . 
One is the lack of proportionality . 
This will not be solved overnight , and I commend the Commissioner (I am talking about judicial training) for ensuring that we fix the issue of trivial cases dominating and creating a credibility problem for the European Arrest Warrant . 
But that also requires the Council (I am not referring just to Hungary , I am talking about the Member States) to help us in pushing forward the procedural guarantees , and the issue of unacceptable pre-trial detention periods for many citizens in my own country . 
These are the situations which create the problems for a tool which could be effective if used properly . 
But the hardest case is going to be creating an even playing field in relation to procedural defence rights . 
This is why within my group , which has [called for] the letter of rights , we take seriously both the quality and speed of the legislation which we need to ensure that the European Arrest Warrant can be the effective tool that it should be for catching serious , organised criminals , and that its credibility must not be diminished by the many trivial cases and uneven playing field that we currently see . 
This is the position we want to see for our group , and we believe the commitment is here . 
But we must pay close attention , particularly to the Member States when they ask for the European Arrest Warrant to be effective , but , on the other hand , do not carry out the actions to help us get the legislation to create that even playing field . 
(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))
on behalf of the EFD Group . - Mr President , Claude Moraes talked about the lack of proportionality , etc . 
We can all agree on that , but the one thing - the elephant in the room - that nobody has talked about this afternoon is the fact that the court cannot look at the prima facie evidence against the accused person and exercise any discretion about whether they should be extradited or not . 
We have many constituents affected by this . 
The most notable case is Andrew Symeou . 
I sat through the appeal court hearings and heard the judges . 
It was obvious from the look on their faces that they realised there was no real evidence against this boy; the evidence was contradictory , the statements appeared to have been concocted by the police , and in no way should he have been extradited . 
How would you address that problem and the fact that the courts cannot take into account the prima facie evidence , or lack of it , against an accused person ? 
Mr President , for an arrest warrant , there has to be prima facie evidence . 
You cannot execute an arrest warrant without the judiciary understanding what the simple facts of the case are . 
In the Andrew Symeou case , the underlying problems , I say to Gerard Batten , were procedural problems: the detention periods and court system after the arrest warrant was executed . 
You talk about the appeal procedure . 
It was the period after the execution of the arrest warrant which was problematic , and which we are trying to fix today in this debate . 
Mr President , the previous debate was passionate and also fascinating and this one is much more consensual . 
I get the impression that no one is questioning the effectiveness of extradition , of the European Arrest Warrant , the reduction in the length of proceedings and therefore , in a nutshell , the fight against crime . 
However , the way the mandate has been used has also led , as we have all said , to abuses and abusive practices: abusive practices when it is used for petty crime , and here I am not talking about the myriad farcical instances of thefts of bicycles , piglets and the like , and rather more serious abusive practices when there are disproportionate detentions , when innocent people are jailed and when the right to appeal these decisions is abused . 
Some years ago , the group to which I belong defended the need to introduce safeguards on the use of the European Arrest Warrant and I am pleased to have heard you , Commissioner , this afternoon , mention improvements to the procedure through the creation of guides for the Member States as well as guides for detainees . 
I welcome this because I think that the European Arrest Warrant is very well understood by our fellow citizens , and is a crucial test in showing just what Europe is capable of in order to consolidate justice in Europe . 
Mr President , the European Union Member States need effective tools for the fight against crime , particularly organised crime , which is the most serious kind . 
In this regard , it should be said that the European Arrest Warrant responds to a need , particularly in view of the fact that it is not only honest citizens who mostly take advantage of the freedom to move around the European Union , but also criminals , who do not by any means exercise their rights for tourism or business purposes , but for criminal activities , or to avoid being brought to justice in their own country or in the country in which they committed the crime . 
The existence and operation of this instrument is therefore to be welcomed , but we should also welcome the fact that it is being monitored . 
As well as merits , every new legal institution has certain flaws which are worth identifying , and it is also worth thinking about how to remedy them . 
In this instance , I think that it is worth considering whether restrictions should be introduced concerning use of the EAW for the most trivial crimes , for example , those punishable by up to two years in prison . 
This should be the subject of serious consideration . 
(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))
Mr President , I think I am right in saying that Mr Ziobro is from Poland . 
I agreed with his last remark as I heard it in translation . 
It is often said that Poland is one example of a country where there is no threshold test for the issuing of arrest warrants , either domestically or for European Arrest Warrants . 
Has a reform in your criminal justice system been considered so that prosecutors have some discretion as to whether to issue an arrest warrant and do not have to pursue every single complaint ? 
In that way , the famous small offences like the stolen piglet would not be so much of a problem . 
We very much appreciate all the Poles who are in the UK , especially in London , most of whom of course are not criminals . 
But , because there are lots of Poles in the UK , most of whom are very welcome , we get lots of arrest warrants from Poland . 
(PL) Mr President , I should like to thank Mrs Ludford very much for her question . 
We are indeed aware of the problem to which you have been so kind as to draw my attention . 
Polish courts take a very rigorous approach to these regulations , and also apply them to what can sometimes seem to be trivial matters . 
In view of the fact that many of our fellow countrymen live in London , for example , warrants are sometimes issued in questionable cases of this kind . 
In my opinion , it would therefore be reasonable for the Commission to consider introducing more general solutions , which would potentially also apply to other countries , in order to ensure that it would not be possible for the warrant to be issued for entirely trivial matters of this kind , for example , two-year imprisonments , and instead only for the serious punishments for which it was put in place . 
Mr President , I am very grateful to Mrs Ludford for asking that question , because it was on the tip of my tongue as well . 
Last week , I attended the proceedings in Poland against Mr Cor Disselkoen - his name has been mentioned already today . 
He is a Dutch national who was extradited to Poland on the basis of a European Arrest Warrant for an affair dating back to the mid-1990s . 
In the few days that he was behind bars - because , eventually , the Dutch and the Polish judges came to an arrangement - in those few days , the guard there stole the medications which he takes for his heart condition . 
The problem is not only how the European Arrest Warrant is carried out , but also that prison conditions in various countries in Europe are such that you really cannot carry on sending people there any more . 
The judge in the country to which the request is addressed should also have the discretion to say: ' I will not extradite people to a country in which prison facilities are inhumane and , as a judge , I will uphold Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights ' . 
I agree with the Council that countries should be discreet about cases in respect of which they issue such a request , but countries should also have the freedom to say: ' That is such a minor offence , I am not going to extradite people for that ' . 
Therefore , it is very important for Poland to change the way it administers justice . 
(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))
(BG) I assume that you are talking about the same case which was mentioned a short time ago . 
The fellow Member spoke about it and I then wanted to ask him a question , but was not given the floor . 
When you are talking about such specific cases , please mention the names of the people whose rights have been violated so that we can hear them . 
This is why I will now ask you to give the name of this person who is being talked about , because we must name people whose rights have been violated . 
(NL) I make no secret of that , Mr Stoyanov . 
His name was mentioned earlier , as well , although it is possible that your interpreter did not pass it on . 
His name is Mr Cor Disselkoen . 
I also have a case concerning Mr Hörchner , another Dutch national . 
I have now mentioned Mr Disselkoen ' s name and he is not at all embarrassed about that , because he is eager for the European Arrest Warrant to be changed and will be happy to talk about it in public . 
Mr President , a great deal could be said about the European Arrest Warrant and the application of it by the Member States , some of which has already been said by my fellow Members . 
I want to focus on a specific and important aspect: full respect for human and procedural rights . 
Suspects and defendants have rights both as people and as parties to proceedings . 
However , often they are disregarded . 
Detention on remand and the detention conditions referred to by Mr de Jong are typical examples . 
The main reason for this is because it is taken as given that human rights enjoy the same respect throughout Europe . 
However , this clearly is not the case , because certain rights are interpreted differently from one Member State to another , such as the right to silence , or simply because certain procedures differ , such as the period of detention on remand . 
What do you intend to do about this Commissioner ? 
Will you propose specific measures , such as the introduction of a special provision on human rights which will allow judges to examine the content of cases , as happens in the United Kingdom and Ireland , or will they continue to simply rubber stamp judgments handed down in other Member States ? 
Will you make provision for the suspect or defendant to be heard , so that the judge can decide whether or not he should be sent back to the country in which he is wanted , in order to prevent abuse , such as extradition for political opinions ? 
Do you intend to propose such changes within the framework of the road map on procedural rights or by amending legislation on the European Arrest Warrant ? 
Mr President , in the Anglo-American world , the primary purpose of the law is to protect people from random arrest and arbitrary imprisonment . 
The law in continental Europe , in particular , the former Eastern bloc , simply does not have that priority and it is ridiculous to pretend otherwise . 
Under the European Arrest Warrant , everybody in Britain can be extradited - under Bulgarian law , for example - and there is not much a British judge can do about it . 
To make matters worse , the British Government has opted into the European Investigation Order , which is a further attack on the liberties of the British people . 
The Liberal Democrats , who sponsor all this , call themselves the party of civil liberties . 
This is piffle ! 
The Liberal Democrats ' commitment to civil liberties comes to a grinding halt at Calais .

Is the Earl of Dartmouth aware that it was the Liberal Democrats , with support from the Conservatives in the Upper Chamber of the British Parliament , who managed to insert in the 2003 Extradition Act which implemented the European Arrest Warrant a power for a judge to refuse a surrender under a European Arrest Warrant if fundamental rights of that person would be breached . 
I am looking towards Mr Kirkhope , because his and my party cooperated on that . 
UKIP just shouts impotently from the sidelines while we get on and do the business of making sure that fundamental rights are protected . 
You should be putting your emphasis on persuading the courts to invoke Article 21 of the 2003 Extradition Act . 
I was there in the House of Lords and I helped move that amendment . 
Nothing of what you have said has invalidated the measured criticisms of what we and others are saying now . 
I would also say that you are entirely mistaken if you think that better translation rights are any sort of cure at all for this flawed piece of legislation which is ruining people ' s lives . 
Mr President , the arrest warrant hearings have very little in common with extradition hearings that preceded the 2003 Act . 
Even at the main hearing , the court does not consider the evidence but only 10 so-called legal bars to surrender . 
Lack of evidence is no bar to extradition . 
Even people accused of behaviour that is not an offence in the extraditing country can be surrendered under the European Arrest Warrant if the offence is one for which there is no requirement for dual criminality . 
Whilst most of these are serious violent , sexual or dishonesty offences , the list also includes the nebulous thought-crime offences beloved in so many continental countries , so that the arrested person could be sent for trial , or rather automatic conviction , to one of those wretched places . 
The fact that such warrants are issued for the purpose of prosecuting a person on the grounds of his political opinions ought to constitute a legal bar to surrender , but I suspect that some political opinions would be less equal than others . 
We were sold the European Arrest Warrant on a promise that it would be used to send terrorists to justice , but the miscarriages of justice in the case of Garry Mann , Deborah Dark , Edmond Arapi , Andrew Symeou and many others , had no terrorist elements at all . 
Worst of all have been the cases of people being extradited for questioning without a charge having been made . 
We must reinstate the requirement that a court will extradite a person only when there is compelling evidence that a serious offence under the extraditing country ' s laws has been committed . 
(RO) Mr President , the European Arrest Warrant is an effective instrument for combating and controlling cross-border crime at EU level . 
It has proved effective in speeding up the transfer between EU countries of people suspected of committing serious crimes , including terrorism and organised crime . 
However , all too frequently , there have been cases where this instrument has been used to deal with minor crimes . 
Cases which were extremely unequal in severity were given equal treatment . 
Warrants have been issued when their use was both unnecessary and disproportionate . 
This has led not only to unjust situations for defendants , but has also created an unjustified burden on the resources of the state executing the warrant . 
The disproportionate use of this key instrument for fighting cross-border crime helps undermine confidence in it . 
This will make some states carry out a proportionality check based on their own rules when they decide to execute a European Arrest Warrant . 
This will result in it being applied inconsistently and unevenly and , therefore , in a lack of trust in the concept of mutual recognition . 
The right to legal aid must be guaranteed in both the state issuing the warrant and the one executing it so that the right to defence is applied in an appropriate manner . 
This is why we wanted to ask the Commission and Council these questions . 
We need to have a guarantee that the standards of criminal justice and the prison conditions in the European Union do not result in a lack of confidence among the judicial systems in Member States . 
In conclusion , I , too , would like to thank Commissioner Reding for all the actions she has taken to strengthen the procedural rights in criminal proceedings . 
(ES) Mr President , Commissioner Reding , the fact is that the abuse of fundamental rights is one of the most significant weaknesses , as we have been saying here all afternoon . 
However , it is not even going to be possible to safeguard these procedural rights , which we have already debated and which we are going to discuss as part of the package of procedural rights . 
It will be impossible to resolve certain problems regarding prisons or preventive detention periods , for example , because they are not covered by the procedural rights package . 
They clearly fall under the powers of the Member States . 
On the issue of proportionality and minor crimes , however , I would like to tell you , Commissioner Reding , that none of the crimes I have heard mentioned this afternoon - thefts of ties , piglets and bicycles - are covered by the arrest warrant . 
The 32 crimes included only relate to organised crime , unless piglets or ties are being stolen by armed and organised criminal gangs . 
In other words , you can make fun with examples that we do not even know about right now , because the problem , fundamentally , is that we do not have any common statistical instrument with which to really tackle this issue . 
(The President cut off the speaker)
(FI) Mr President , the Hungarian representative said here that the problem is not this instrument - the European Arrest Warrant - itself , but that it relates to each Member State ' s criminal justice policy . 
Well , now she is putting her headphones on . 
Yes , well , to my mind , this is actually a case of being economical with the truth , because now we have to admit that the European Arrest Warrant was a problem from the beginning , since we acted as if all Member States would implement certain legal norms and minimum standards for criminal proceedings . 
The truth is , of course , that we have only just started to establish them now , with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon . 
I would like to point out that the European Court of Human Rights has already stated that in asylum cases , no one can be sent back to Greece , for example , because the conditions in prisons there are so poor . 
I wonder when it will happen that you cannot extradite someone on the basis of the European Arrest Warrant because the conditions in the prisons in the country requesting extradition are so dreadful . 
In my opinion , the Commission should be prepared for that . 
(PT) Mr President , the European Union is an experiment made up of experiments: the euro area , this very Parliament in which we find ourselves , the Schengen area and a number of other instruments are all experiments . 
The problem is that politicians are very often less humble than scientists . 
Scientists are the first to acknowledge it when an experiment has not gone as they had hoped . 
In the case of the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) , we now know that this has problems and has caused doubts . 
Commissioner Reding should be credited with having had the honesty to confirm that this warrant has had problems and causes doubts , and that there are proportionality tests , which must be passed when warrants are issued and which should not be applied automatically without a judge having a slower , more measured look at them . 
Therefore , the solution should not be to abolish the EAW , which is clearly useful . 
We want a rapist or murderer to be unable to cross a border and be free . 
However , the EAW should be complemented with effective instruments for protecting defendants , with the presence of a lawyer and the right to translation , which Baroness Ludford has already tackled in her report , but also , and very crucially , the assessment of detention conditions in European prisons . 
Moreover , let us not fool ourselves or be under any illusion: being detained in a prison in country A or country B is not the same thing as being imprisoned in Europe . 
It is very important that these conditions be assessed and that there be very determined work by the European Commission to assess detention conditions , so that they can be harmonised and so that , in this way , the EAW can be applied with more confidence . 
(BG) Mr President , I have previously heard the arguments put forward by the critics of the European Arrest Warrant from the mouths of my fellow Members from the nationalist movements as well . 
However , our arguments were presented then as being Eurosceptic , as if we were some kind of enemy of progress . 
As a result , this warrant came into force . 
However , this evening I heard something else awful coming from the lips of Mrs Győri . 
What she actually said was that the effectiveness of the arrest warrant has justified the instances of rights violations . 
Mrs Győri , I am familiar with a principle in criminal law which states: ' Better 10 guilty men go free than to convict a single innocent ' . 
However , from the perspective of disproportionate response , it is normal for police officers to use whatever is put in their hands and they will take every opportunity they are afforded . 
There is only one answer to the old question ' Who will guard the guards themselves ? ' : ' The law guards the guards ' . 
We as legislators , with the Commission as initiator , Parliament and the Council as colegislators , must do our utmost to ensure that the law really does guard the guards . 
(IT) Mr President , the European Arrest Warrant is undoubtedly a fundamental tool in the fight against terrorism and organised crime . 
I think that there is an understanding and agreement on this on the part of everyone who has spoken , including the Presidency and the Commission . 
At the same time , it is confirmation of how police and judicial cooperation in a cross-border approach to crime can achieve important objectives . 
Waiting times have been resolved , and the costs will now have to be verified - and this needs to be looked into further . 
Trust between the Member States is crucial in this process , which is undoubtedly positive . 
In the meantime , however , it is important to ensure that the instrument is applied uniformly in all the Member States , with a real distinction between serious crimes , for which it is intended and sanctioned , and non-serious crimes . 
It may be helpful - and here I am addressing Commissioner Reding - to involve the European Public Prosecutor ' s Office , which , once up and running , could verify and assess in some way these judgments by the Member States ' judicial authorities , who will undoubtedly need to receive further training . 
It is true that detention conditions are not the same in all the Member States , but we are confident that next week , the Commission will issue the communication and Green Paper on basic detention conditions , which should list additional action to be taken . 
Therefore , with proper use of the arrest warrant , proportionality , strict application of the instrument , better exchange of information and training on European issues for magistrates , we are sure that uniform application of this important instrument can be achieved in full . 
(FR) Mr President , Commissioner , we can see that the application of the European Arrest Warrant raises the issue of detention which is very unevenly applied from one Member State to another . 
Some States show demonstrable laxity when it comes to respecting fundamental rights in a prison environment . 
Furthermore , amongst the 600 000 prisoners in the European Union , increasing numbers are detained in a Member State other than their own , due , precisely , to the European Arrest Warrant . 
Consequently , they do not enjoy the fundamental rights guaranteed by their state of origin . 
In circumstances such as these , there is no point in hurling abuse at each other; action must be taken . 
That is why , last January , my colleague , Mr Lambrinidis and I submitted a written statement calling for the harmonisation of detention standards throughout the European Union , and the introduction of independent national inspection mechanisms . 
I hope , Commissioner , that in the Green Papers that you will propose , you will bear this issue in mind , and that there will soon be a common platform of minimum rights which applies to all Member States . 
(DE) Mr President , Mrs Györi , Commissioner Reding , as has already been made abundantly clear by the previous speakers , in recent years , the European Arrest Warrant has proven itself to be a useful instrument for fighting crime . 
Criminals in Europe are no longer free to exploit our open borders in the way that they might otherwise have been able to . 
Despite the innumerable successes that have taken place , however , the past seven years have also shown that the system is not yet perfect and that it is not being used in the way originally intended . 
You drew attention to some of these weaknesses in your recent report . 
For example , there is no right to legal representation , prison conditions are , in some cases , disgraceful and very often the investigations take an extremely long time . 
The fundamental point , which has also already been mentioned several times , is the failure of issuing states to apply consistent or indeed any consideration of whether the measure is proportionate . 
This matter is particularly close to my heart because the real intention of the European Arrest Warrant is frequently being undermined by the systematic issue of arrest warrants , often for minor offences . 
In Poland , for example - as has also been mentioned previously - where the largest number of European Arrest Warrants are issued , the judicial authorities simply do not have the power to stop national proceedings because the system has become automatic . 
I do not believe that this is what was intended . 
Before a European Arrest Warrant is issued , therefore , consideration should be given to how serious the offence is , what the expected penalty is and whether there is a simpler way of dealing with the matter . 
Finally , perhaps a cost / benefit analysis should also be carried out so that minor offences are not prosecuted at great expense . 
As I see it , consistency also means adapting the existing rules to reality . 
In this respect , I should be interested to learn what steps you are thinking of taking in this area . 
(EL) Mr President , I have listened very carefully to the comments made by my fellow Members . 
I shall start with our common assumption that combating crime is not just a national issue; it is also a European issue . 
The European Arrest Warrant marked an important step forwards in combating crime , by helping to create a European area of justice and to combat cross-border crime and terrorism . 
It also strengthens the free movement of persons within the Union , which we debated at great length recently in connection with the Schengen Agreement , by ensuring that opening the borders will not turn out to be for the benefit of those seeking to evade justice . 
Of course , voices are also being raised in protest - and I , too , endorse what was said by Mr Voss and other members - about its often unsatisfactory and disproportionate application at national level . 
We also debated cost and proportionality and everything that needs to be applied in order to strengthen the arrest warrant . 
However , I would remind the House - this is something that we faced in Greece recently in important cases - that , even now , there are people being prosecuted for serious crimes of fraud and corruption in a Member State of the Union who disappear or manage to get off and escape arrest by making use of the different procedural provisions and different regulations in the various national laws . 
Consequently , I think that there can be no doubt as to the value of the European Arrest Warrant . 
To close , I should like to stress that you are right , Commissioner , when you say that we need to make maximum possible use of Interpol and information available from the Schengen system . 
We need the closest possible harmonisation between the Member States so that , ultimately , we have a harmonised , modern policy which is up to the job , as the times demand . 
(PL) Mr President , the aim of the European Arrest Warrant is to enforce the law and ensure the security of citizens in the European Union . 
Freedom of movement for individuals must not make it easier for criminals to avoid being held accountable for criminal acts committed on the territory of another Member State . 
There have , however , been alarming reports concerning use of the warrant , such as the recent Commission report and Commissioner Reding ' s statement , in which she said that the Member States should ensure that the warrant is used correctly , and that it should not be issued mechanically or automatically for relatively minor offences . 
This statement bears testimony to the potential for misuse of the arrest warrant by the judiciary . 
Therefore , although I am entirely in favour of striving to ensure the maximum level of security for EU citizens , I would call on the Commission to monitor use of the warrant and to take steps aimed at preventing irregularities during use of this procedure by courts . 
Mr President , I had the honour to be the rapporteur in this House when the European Arrest Warrant was approved in 2001 and 2002 . 
Colleagues who were in the House at the time will recall that we urged the Commission and the Council to build more civil liberties safeguards into the legislation , and we secured from the Commission a commitment to a draft directive on the rights of defendants in criminal legal proceedings . 
Not all of the safeguards we called for were inserted , and the draft directive on defendants ' rights sat for many years in the Council ' s in-tray . 
The results of these omissions are at the root of this debate today . 
In 2002 , Parliament had no powers of codecision in these matters . 
Nonetheless , we believed that , on balance , the arrest warrant was the right move . 
As many speakers have said in this debate , the arrest warrant is a hugely valuable tool in the fight against cross-border crime . 
It has brought justice to many victims . 
Where problems have arisen , they have come from poor implementation into national law , from frivolous use of the warrant for petty crimes and from unacceptable conditions of detention . 
All of these can , must and are being dealt with . 
I salute the authors of the oral questions today , with the exception of one who opposes all judicial cooperation , for speeding up the process of improving it . 
Mr President , I , too , personally believe this whole debate needs a dose of common sense now . 
I still believe that some sort of European Arrest Warrant is a necessary tool to fight crime and terrorism across the Union , particularly given the huge free movement of people now moving between Member States , including - sadly - criminals . 
I also believe that the number of errors or miscarriages is relatively small - but still too many . 
We must now not throw the baby out with the bathwater , which is what some of the colleagues in this House would like . 
We need to seriously review the workings of the arrest warrant to include only a limited list of serious crimes - always satisfying the condition of double criminality - as being the only ones justiciable under the European Arrest Warrant . 
We must also respect fundamental human rights and include safeguards like habeas corpus . 
The large majority of UK-surrendered individuals were actually , as it turned out , migrants from other States of the European Union charged with crimes - normally major crimes , not petty crimes . 
It is ironic that UKIP , which was opposed to their right to come to the UK in the first place , is now trying to make it extremely difficult and expensive for the British taxpayer to send them back to their countries to face justice . 
(DE) Mr President , in recent years , European Arrest Warrants have been issued for trivial offences , such as the theft of two car tyres or the theft of a piglet . 
It is no longer being used to fight terrorism and serious crime , as was originally intended . 
As far as I am concerned , the European Arrest Warrant is a clear contradiction of the principle of subsidiarity . 
It overrides the most important function of citizenship - which is the protection that citizenship affords - and the Member States are obliged to surrender their own citizens . 
Since the countries of the Union have very differing legal systems , they are obliged to surrender people even if the act is not an offence in the surrendering country . 
For me , the European Arrest Warrant symbolises the concept of a European state and citizenship of the European Union at the expense of the sovereignty of the Member States and at the expense of citizens ' rights . 
(IT) Mr President , Commissioner , the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) is the first instrument implemented in the European Union that puts into practice the principle of mutual recognition of criminal judgments . 
That instrument is fundamentally important now and should remain so , especially for fighting mafia groups and organised crime . 
In the report on organised crime , for which I am the rapporteur in the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , we are proposing a series of considerations and requests concerning the European Arrest Warrant . 
One of the main requests is for the EAW to be strengthened and better enforced by the Member States , bearing in mind the requirements and the specific nature of the fight against organised crime . 
I therefore ask the Commission how it intends to proceed and whether it intends to submit a proposal to remove the Member States ' discretion in the transposition of Articles 3 and 4 of the framework decision , concerning the grounds for mandatory non-execution and optional non-execution . 
With regard to the grounds for optional non-execution , I also ask whether it may not be appropriate to restrict them in the case of offences typically attributable to organised crime , including the offence of association with a mafia organisation , for which double criminality should not apply anyway . 
Vice-President of the Commission . - Mr President , there is general agreement in this House that the European Arrest Warrant is a positive tool and has served the European Union well and acted as a security . 
The negative elements are in the implementation . 
Those negative elements have to be eliminated . 
The proposals which the Commission has put on the table for this purpose are the proportionality test , where we have to look at the seriousness of the offence , the length of the sentence which this offence would carry , and the cost / benefit of executing such an arrest warrant . 
In order to make this proportionality test easier , the Commission will present an amended handbook as a guideline for the application of the proportionality test . 
Training , which is very high on the agenda for the coming weeks , months and years , will be very important because we have to train judges , prosecutors and lawyers in the application of our European rules . 
The minimum standards for suspects and accused persons , which are under implementation , are very important because they also apply to the European Arrest Warrant . 
I agree with all those parliamentarians who have underlined the problem of prison conditions in Europe . 
I would like to tell them that next week , the Commission will adopt a Green Paper on detention . 
National governments are responsible for detention issues and prison management , but the Commission ' s role is to make sure that judicial cooperation works and fundamental rights of all citizens are upheld . 
That is why the Green Paper will kick off a public consultation , which will run until 30 November and will help to explore more closely the links between detention issues and mutual trust in Europe ' s area of justice . 
Everybody in this House knows that detention conditions have a direct impact on the smooth functioning of the mutual recognition of judicial decisions and are the basis for cooperation between judges in the EU . 
But the system is impeded if judges refuse - sometimes rightly so - to extradite accused persons because the detention conditions in the requesting country are substandard . 
We all know about prison overcrowding and the allegations of poor treatment of detainees . 
These factors undermine the trust that is necessary for judicial cooperation . 
The time that a person can spend in detention before being tried in court and during court proceedings varies a lot between Member States . 
We have a lot of work ahead of us , and I know I can count on Parliament . 
I hope I can also count on the Member States . 
President-in-Office of the Council . - Mr President , thank you very much for this debate . 
It is clear that an overwhelming majority says that it is good that we have a cooperation system for our judiciaries , the European Arrest Warrant . 
The system works . 
It is not perfect . 
It should be improved further . 
We are , of course , open to more efficient use and better implementation . 
I agree that mistakes , arrests of innocent people , etc . , should be avoided . 
Better implementation is , I think , in the interests of us all . 
I would be more specific on two outstanding issues which were raised several times during the debate . 
First , on proportionality: just to make it clear , a European Arrest Warrant can be issued to prosecute offences which are punishable by at least 12 months ' imprisonment , or to execute a sentence to at least 4 months ' imprisonment . 
This has been standard extradition practice for at least 50 years . 
It is enough to mention the 1957 Council of Europe Convention on Extradition . 
In the fourth round of mutual evaluations on the practical implementation of the European Arrest Warrant in all Member States , it was found that only in a few countries were there examples of issuing European Arrest Warrants for relatively minor offences . 
It seems that , in those few countries , the practice was to issue a European Arrest Warrant every time a national arrest order was issued . 
In general terms , I believe that we should only use the costly system of the European Arrest Warrant for more serious offences . 
I think that those who mentioned this were right . 
Concerning prison conditions: the Member States are under a general obligation to ensure that prison conditions are in accordance with the basic tenets of human dignity and do not violate the prohibition of inhuman and degrading treatment laid down in Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights . 
If people are detained in violation of their basic human rights , they can take action before domestic courts and , later , before the European Court of Human Rights . 
It is doubtful whether Article 85 of the Treaty provides a legal basis for legislative action at EU level on prison conditions as such . 
However , we are , of course , awaiting the Green Paper which the Commissioner has just mentioned with great interest . 
The debate is closed . 
Written statements (Rule 149)
Seven years after the entry into force (on 1 January 2004) of the Council framework decision of 13 June 2002 on the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) and the surrender procedures between Member States , the Commission has published some statistical data collected in the Member States between 2005 and 2009 . 
Before the introduction of the warrant , the average time taken to extradite a wanted person was one year , whereas in these four years in which the EAW has been applied , it has been shown that approximately 50% of wanted persons agreed to their surrender after about 15 days . 
It is essential to take stock of the implementation and operation of the EAW now that doubt is being cast on whether the Schengen Information System is working properly and whether it should be suspended . 
We should not forget that the effectiveness of the EAW in the fight against cross-border crime , organised crime and terrorism depends on the principle of mutual recognition between Member States , which is the basis for having a real European judicial area and also for the Schengen area to work properly . 
It would be a backward step to put this situation in jeopardy; instead , we should concentrate on improving the transposition of the framework decision , especially in terms of protecting fundamental rights . 
The European Arrest Warrant (EAW) was brought in by a 2002 decision and has , to date , been shown to be an effective tool in the fight against cross-border crime , organised crime and terrorism , as was , in fact , stressed by the Commission in a recent report . 
However , there are imperfections in the functioning of the system: there is a possibility that its reputation and effectiveness may be undermined by news of its use for interrogations instead of charges and prosecutions in cases of petty crime . 
It is thus pertinent and urgent that the Council take steps to guarantee that the disproportionate use of the EAW is limited in practice . 
Furthermore , it is advisable to ensure that procedural rights are actually respected: that is , that individuals wanted under the auspices of an EAW have a genuine right to legal aid at their disposal , both in the Member State that issues the warrant and in the Member State where it is implemented . 
It must also be ensured that criminal justice standards and prison conditions in the European Union do not give rise to the Member States legal systems mistrusting each other . 
This is the only way we will be able to talk about genuine effectiveness and the true success of this instrument at European level . 
EU-Russia summit (debate)
The next item is the statement by the Commission , on behalf of the Vice-President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy , on the EU-Russia Summit . 
Mr President , Commissioner , thank you for the good cooperation you have shown in the drafting of the resolution . 
I will not say anything more about the points which the Commissioner has mentioned because they are covered in the resolution . 
As far as the European People ' s Party (Christian Democrats) is concerned , the final declaration of the summit next week must be more than just fine words . 
Russia is our great neighbour; Russia is an important partner . 
We are mutually dependent and the level of that dependence is great , so now we are expecting real agreements that will lead to results . 
What are our priorities ? 
First of all , the Partnership Agreement . 
We need to set the negotiations in motion . 
I expect that the EU will persuade President Medvedev to grant his negotiating team full powers to undertake specific commitments . 
It is high time that we got things moving again on the trade and investment dossier . 
The negotiations on the energy chapter are also behind schedule . 
We need agreements on a solid and transparent energy partnership and one which is based on rules . 
I would also like to hear where we stand on the human rights paragraph . 
For us , for Parliament , this is a vital part of the partnership . 
I see the modernisation pact as a complementary issue , in the same way that the common areas are . 
This is a secondary matter , but it would help if we got the WTO rules through . 
That would help to establish a level playing field while facilitating the investment climate . 
President Medvedev is personally involved in improving the rule of law , but this is not enough , as you have just said yourself . 
We need to be certain that , in the upcoming elections , Russia is going to live up to the obligations it has undertaken under the Council of Europe and the OSCE . 
The elections will be the acid test . 
That , then , also means that new parties must be allowed to register . 
Russia should feel honoured that election observers have been called in well in advance . 
Lastly , the import ban on European vegetables ( . . . )
(The President cut off the speaker)
Mr President , Commissioner , Russia is undoubtedly a very important partner for the European Union , but - as the Commissioner has already said - a very difficult one . 
I hope that the negotiations will not take too long . 
Unfortunately , however , they will not be completed as fast as Mrs Oomen-Ruijten imagines . 
During the process , we need to have a dialogue both with the official elected representatives and with the representatives of civil society , who are often closer to us on matters of democracy and human rights . 
The idea of a Partnership for Modernisation between the European Union and Russia is a good one . 
However , Russia also needs to play its part . 
We need more democracy and less corruption . 
We still hear many investors complaining of legal uncertainty , particularly as regards taxes . 
Above all - as the Commissioner has already mentioned - we need to prepare speedily for Russia ' s accession to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and WTO membership . 
In the area of energy policy , we need Russia to be obliged to acknowledge the principles of a transparent and fair energy policy . 
There is a lot that Russia can do itself , particularly as regards energy efficiency , where there remain many shortcomings . 
Also as regards energy , I would like to bring up something that concerns its neighbour - indeed our common neighbour - Ukraine . 
Right now , Russia is once again attempting to use the issue of energy and energy prices as a political weapon . 
We must absolutely reject that . 
We are committed to the freedom of Ukraine to decide in which markets it wishes to be present and where it wishes to operate . 
We do , after all , want to have trade relations and a trade agreement with Ukraine . 
Russia should not put pressure on Ukraine in this area by giving it the option of either joining the customs union with Kazakhstan and Belarus or paying a high energy price . 
That is something we reject . 
Again , as regards neighbours , we also expect Russia to adhere to the agreements in the treaties in respect of Georgia and to withdraw its troops back to those areas where they were present before the conflict . 
We also hope that Russia will make a positive contribution to resolving the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict . 
On both sides , here it is not a matter of supplying arms , but rather of peaceful mediation between the two sides . 
The Commissioner has already mentioned the importance of visa liberalisation . 
It is particularly important for relations between individuals that people enjoy as much freedom of movement as possible between Russia and the European Union . 
I hope that we will soon make some progress on this . 
One crucial issue , however , will be how the next elections are held . 
Russia needs to be aware that the world , and the democratic world in Europe in particular , will be watching closely to see how these elections are carried out; whether the parties are registered correctly and fairly; and also whether certain individuals or certain parties are excluded from the elections at the outset . 
That is something that should be made clear to Russia at the summit . 
We want to see proper , fair elections in Russia too . 
Russia still has a lot of catching up to do in terms of its economy . 
However , Russia is ready for democracy . 
We want to see democracy in Russia , just as much as the citizens of Russia want this themselves . 
That is our desire and our vision . 
Russia needs to realise that democracy will be good for Russia too . 
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , we hope that further progress will be made at the summit in Nizhny Novgorod with regard to a new and comprehensive Partnership and Cooperation Agreement . 
Both the EU and Russia must keep in mind that a true partnership can only be a straightforward relationship . 
On behalf of the ALDE Group , I would like to invite the representatives of the EU to address all the concerns raised by the European Parliament with their Russian counterparts . 
The European Union will face major difficulties in relations with Russia unless the two partners rely on the same values and principles . 
If the Kremlin moves even further away from democracy and the rule of law , Russia will lose all legitimacy as a partner to the EU . 
For example , the Kremlin has prevented a number of political parties from registering for the State Duma elections on procedural grounds , and the list is likely to be extended to include the People ' s Freedom Party led by Mikhail Kasyanov , Vladimir Milov , Boris Nemtsov and Vladimir Ryzhkov . 
The surging suppression of the opposition must be brought up at the summit and the opposition parties must be allowed to register . 
Ladies and gentlemen , Russia is not China . 
Russia is a member of the Council of Europe and the OSCE; therefore , she must uphold her international commitments and obligations . 
Furthermore , Russia must abide by her own constitution . 
Russia has to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of its neighbours . 
We insist that she stops pressuring Ukraine - as my colleague said just now - for example , as Prime Minister Putin did yesterday when he met the Prime Minister of Ukraine , pressing them to join the customs union with Russia , Belarus and Kazakhstan . 
We cannot accept this . 
We expect Russia to withdraw its troops immediately from Georgia to the pre-conflict positions . 
Lastly , the ALDE Group is very disappointed that , on the eve of the summit , Russia has imposed a disproportional import ban on vegetables from the EU . 
on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , Russia is an important partner for the EU in many respects . 
As a permanent member of the UN Security Council , Russia exercises a potentially decisive influence on international affairs , from our relations with North Korea to its involvement in the UN quartet . 
I also welcome recent calls by President Medvedev for the Libyan tyrant , Muammar Gaddafi , to leave power . 
I also hope that the Kremlin will align itself with the rest of the international community on stopping Iranian nuclear proliferation . 
I also accept that Russia has economic interests in the former Soviet republics , some of which are now - thankfully - gravitating away from Moscow towards the EU . 
However , the EU should continue to insist that it will support and engage with these now-independent countries such as Ukraine , and make sure that the door is left open to them in terms of Euro-Atlantic aspirations . 
In this regard , I hope that the Vice-President / High Representative will raise the issue of Georgia , parts of whose territory remain annexed and occupied illegally by Russian soldiers , and help also to put pressure on Russia to solve the Transnistria question in Moldova . 
I also accept that the Commission is now making the suggestion that the EU-Russia Summit should be annual rather than every six months , which is a good idea and the way forward . 
Russia is not a mature liberal democracy . 
Neither is it a country which enjoys an independent judiciary . 
But whether we like it or not , we still have to engage with the bear . 
Mr President , Commissioner Füle , while , at first glance , it may seem understandable for Russia to protect itself in order to prevent the spread of Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) infection into its territory , a complete ban on imports of European vegetables is not what we expect of a country that aspires to join the World Trade Organisation (WTO) . 
That is also something we will have to talk about in Nizhny Novgorod . 
More important , however , are the political germs , or seeds , that are actually present - the weak beginnings of democracy and the rule of law . 
On these aspects , we should do everything we can within the context of the Partnership for Modernisation to help their roots to spread across Russia and develop . 
President Medvedev has acknowledged that economical and technical modernisation cannot be achieved without a fundamental modernisation of society . 
Yet so far , we have seen little in the way of action to accompany these fine words . 
The representatives of the EU should therefore make it abundantly clear to President Medvedev that the forthcoming elections to the Duma are a test of the credibility of his reform policy . 
Genuine and proper elections form part of the foundations of democracy . 
Anyone who wants pluralism and political competition should ensure that the election standards declared by the Council of Europe are adhered to and should allow long-term election observation by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) at the earliest stage . 
Fair elections start with allowing the registration of parties . 
Regrettably , early indications suggest that the Russian leadership has learnt nothing from the ruling by the European Court of Human Rights that there were no grounds for dissolving the Republican Party and apparently does not wish to allow the newly established People ' s Freedom Party to be registered . 
More Kremlin-backed parties and an All-Russia People ' s Front initiated by Prime Minister Putin are merely leading us down a political blind alley . 
This semblance of competition has led the country into political apathy and devalued the Duma . 
President Medvedev could bring about a breakthrough here and end his Presidency with at least one demonstrable success . 
In the particular cases of Mr Khodorkovsky and Mr Magnitsky , rather than waiting for a ruling from Strasbourg , the judicial arbitrariness should be brought to an end . 
The review of these cases by the Fedotov commission is a good first step . 
Its results and conclusions should be published as soon as possible . 
The future participation of the Civil Society Forum established recently in Prague should be an important topic for discussion during the talks and negotiations between the EU and Russia . 
After all , events in North Africa demonstrate that for effective reform , you need an active civil society . 
The Russian Government should therefore work to bring this about in its own country and endeavour to achieve a partnership for modernisation with civil society . 
Mr President , Commissioner , I have been searching in vain for an answer to the question of why we are debating a resolution on the summit with Russia on the eve of the summit itself and voting on it on the day the summit takes place in Nizhny Novgorod . 
Moreover , the topic was not even included on the agenda of the plenary at the beginning of last week . 
This all smacks of bad planning , and it is now a formality , in my opinion . 
Moreover , instead of striving , through a principled process , for a new agreement on relations with Russia , which we recognise as an important partner , we are notoriously repeating proclamations and demands which clearly have no hope of succeeding . 
We should , first and foremost , build on the issues where progress can be achieved . 
An example is the progress over agreements on the planned easing and possible final removal of the mutual visa arrangements with Russia . 
Instead of this , we are criticising the position of Russia in the case of imports of vegetables from the EU . 
How does our own behaviour appear , however , from outside the Union ? 
When looking for the source of the deadly bacteria , and in the absence of hard evidence , we accuse each other , restrict imports and exports of commodities and claim compensation . 
We can surely draw our own conclusions as to the level of confidence we are inspiring , and not just in Russia . 
Mr President , the dialogue between the European Union and Russia must be expanded as much as possible in various areas , from the economy to human rights , because there are no alternatives to dialogue . 
Europe and Russia are , in fact , interdependent , both economically and politically . 
I am thinking of unresolved international issues such as energy security , the Maghreb , Iran ' s nuclear capability , terrorism , the Caucasus , Nagorno-Karabakh , climate change and others . 
Russia is a strategic partner for Europe , not least because of the synergies that may be built in future . 
As already happens to some extent , Moscow can supply us with mineral and energy resources as well as collaborate on military security and the fight against terrorism and organised crime Europe can contribute with financial resources , scientific and technological capabilities and our long-standing experience in the field of democracy and human rights . 
Russia ' s future is linked to Europe ' s and must be developed with perseverance , without complacency and despite the many difficulties that currently exist . 
In that respect , the conclusion of the strategic partnership agreement between the European Union and Russia is of great importance for our common future . 
(HU) Mr President , in connection with the upcoming summit , I would like to draw the negotiating delegation ' s attention to two things . 
Firstly , I would like to encourage them to reconsider the importance of Russian energy imports and , secondly , to extend the Partnership Agreement in a way that EU representatives could participate as observers in the elections to be held in December this year and in the Presidential elections to be held in March 2013 . 
As we can see , energy imports from Russia are likely to increase , bearing in mind that many European nuclear power plants will be closed down after carrying out the stress tests . 
So we are , once again , beginning to be concerned that we will again be more dependent on Russia in the future . 
However , I would like to remind you that the coin has another side . 
Russia is just as dependent on the European Union , because they sell most of their products to us . 
If we do not buy their energy products , then the Russian economy will encounter serious stability problems in the future . 
(DE) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , Russia and the European Union are partners because of their mutual interests and because of their geographical location . 
This is the case whether we like it or not . 
We must make this partnership a positive and constructive one . 
That is why we need to make progress on the Partnership Agreement and on visa facilitation , to add substance to the Partnership for Modernisation , in order to work towards this . 
We need to realise , however , that this gives rise to obligations on both sides , including in respect of membership of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) , in that you cannot just continue doing as you like; rather , these agreed contractual or international rules are binding on everyone and there is no place for arbitrariness in reciprocal dealings . 
This also precludes using energy as a political weapon , for example . 
These mutual interests must be handled positively and constructively , and where external policy is concerned , this naturally also means that Russia must take on some responsibility . 
At the moment , there is the case of Syria in the United Nations Security Council . 
In such cases , Russia must make a constructive contribution to the creation of a peaceful international community . 
This also means , however , accepting the sovereign rights of neighbouring states and their decisions as regards entering into the alliances that they wish to enter into . 
Moreover , Russia must make a positive contribution in the case of ' frozen conflicts ' and must now bring to an end the unlawful circumstances in Abkhazia and South Ossetia . 
We have a shared responsibility in the global world . 
It is clear that Russia and the European Union have substantial mutual interests in this global order , and in defining these interests , we must ensure that Russia recognises that democracy and the rule of law are also crucial for internal development . 
A degree of conditionality is called for not just in relations with us alone; a country in which there is no rule of law is also not a good place to invest , because there is no legal certainty . 
A country without democracy and the rule of law cannot really make progress in the long term for the benefit of its own citizens . 
Let us hope that the Partnership for Modernisation and other matters will help us to find a common and positive way forward here . 
(DE) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would just like to mention two points because Mr Swoboda has already mentioned a number of points on behalf of our group . 
Russia is indeed at an important crossroads . 
Its internal political situation will be determined by the elections to the Duma in December and the question of who will continue the modernisation embarked upon as president from 2012 . 
One can also put a positive slant on this . 
There could be no better opportunity to strengthen international confidence in Russia ' s development . 
This is conditional upon there being fair elections , fair opportunities for registration and access to the media for the candidates , to ensure at least an element of equal opportunity . 
My second point concerns the Partnership for Modernisation between the EU and Russia . 
This opens up new opportunities for effective cooperation . 
We should therefore not miss the opportunity to support Russia vigorously in this modernisation - not just by investing in the modernisation of the economy , but also in its society . 
Governments put things down on paper and , as we all know , you can say what you like on paper . 
Citizens , however , become very restless if what is stated on paper is not implemented . 
Civil participation and the involvement of civil society , entrepreneurs , researchers , young people and artists are essential to a self-determined society of solidarity . 
We can only successfully support such modernisation , however , if people can come together easily in order to learn from each other and exchange experiences . 
For these reasons , the EU and Russia should finally reach agreement on the common steps that need to be taken to achieve visa-free travel and how these can be implemented , in order to achieve results as quickly as possible . 
We have been talking about people in the Kaliningrad region and thinking about facilitation . 
A month ago , this House decided that visa facilitation should be allowed for cultural purposes . 
We have been talking about whether perhaps particular consideration should be given to young people here . 
These are all good suggestions to get the ball rolling , but they are no substitute for an overall solution . 
I would therefore urge the Commission to step up the pace . 
You can count on our support in any case , including as regards some of the more hesitant certain Member States . 
(Applause)
(DE) Madam President , it is hardly conceivable that our relations with Russia are based on an agreement dating from 1994 . 
We have not succeeded in resolving anything new since then . 
We alternate between cooperation and confrontation with Russia . 
Where the neighbourhood is concerned , we deplore the war with Georgia , the pressure brought to bear on Ukraine , the recognition of President Lukashenko in Belarus and the split in the Republic of Moldova as a result of the conflict in Transnistria . 
At the same time , our cooperation with Russia in the Security Council on the issue of Libya or on Iran ' s nuclear programme is pleasing . 
As regards Russia itself , the new paradigm is what is known as the Partnership for Modernisation . 
Yet what is modernity without democracy ? 
In the list of priorities that you have just given , Commissioner Füle , human rights came after cucumbers and the rule of law after tomatoes . 
Is that the best we can expect in this area ? 
Do we expect nothing more of Russia ' s democratisation ? 
I believe that as Parliament , we must make it clear that we do expect something; for example , fair elections - there must be progress there . 
There is , though , one thing that I would like to say quite clearly: such progress is often to be achieved at expert level . 
Two summits a year is too much . 
Let us have one summit , as we do with America . 
We have enough exchange with Russia in the specialist areas . 
Otherwise , we will have summits with no real content , and that would not be good either . 
(PL) Madam President , in my opinion , the most significant aspects of relations with Russia are energy policy and human rights . 
Russia is pursuing a strategic goal of bringing individual countries under its control by exploiting the issue of gas when conducting foreign policy . 
Just in the last few days , the Russian authorities have used blackmail to put pressure on Ukraine , making changes in gas prices dependent on the country joining the Russian customs union or a merger between Gazprom and Naftogaz . 
The above actions quite obviously put an end to discussions on the creation of an EU-Ukraine free trade area . 
Long-term agreements on gas supplies are also a way of influencing the policies of EU Member States . 
We should therefore commend the position of the European Commission , which has acknowledged that the agreement concluded by the Polish Government does not comply with EU law . 
Prices for Russian gas in Central Europe are already almost twice as high as those offered to Western European countries . 
Russia ' s discrediting of shale gas extraction projects is causing additional alarm . 
The human rights problem is most apparent in the Khodorkovsky case . 
There can be no question that this issue must be raised during the summit , in view of the ruling handed down by the European Court of Human Rights on the unlawfulness of the arrest and detention of the Russian businessman . 
Madam President , I would like to remind Commissioner Füle of his very well-appreciated communication on the European Neighbourhood Policy; and I can hear , Commissioner , that you basically concede that we should apply the same principle to Russia as well , even if Russia is not a part of the Eastern Neighbourhood . 
But we should indeed call for what you have termed deep democracy , and we have to work seriously to support civil society in Russia . 
I would like to highlight some points in the joint resolution that the European Parliament will adopt tomorrow . 
We underline the need to maintain close contacts and support programmes for the development of civil society in Russia . 
I would like to inform you , Commissioner , that today there is very worrying news from Nizhny Novgorod , where the summit will be just starting . 
I have been informed by civil society organisations there that pre-emptive measures have been taken by the law enforcement agencies . 
Attempts have been made to question people who could communicate with the EU representatives , and this is completely unacceptable . 
Even people who work on children ' s rights have been warned not to go to Nizhny Novgorod . 
The credit cards of the main local organiser of the civil society event - which is , by the way , the first ever linked to an EU-Russia Summit - have been blocked (for technical reasons , of course) , and her car licence plates have mysteriously disappeared . 
Commissioner , I ask that you make sure that the EU representatives at the summit in Nizhny Novgorod will give recognition and support to the civil society organisations . 
To this end , I , together with my colleague , Mr Schulz , the Vice-Chair of the Joint EU-Russia Parliamentary Committee , have sent a letter to President Barroso , Vice-President / High Representative Ashton and President Von Rompuy . 
(EL) Madam President , firstly , may I wish you every success at tomorrow ' s summit , the agenda of which includes global governance , the global economy , the accession of Russia to the WTO and international issues , including developments in North Africa and the Middle East . 
Russia is the EU ' s third biggest trading partner . 
EU exports to Russia total EUR 65 . 6 billion . 
According to official statistics , the Russian economy is growing at a rate of 4% , despite the economic climate , and this is forecast to continue for a long time . 
Its accession to the World Trade Organisation will create numerous opportunities in economic relations between the European Union and Russia . 
At the same time , however , it will bring about innovative changes in energy , nuclear energy and international security . 
(DE) Madam President , Commissioner , we are aware that Russia is of significance to the EU , not just where economic matters are concerned , but also as a strategic partner . 
The ban on imports of EU vegetables that has been imposed by Moscow is undoubtedly problematic in the run-up to the negotiations on Russia ' s accession to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) , and we should make sure that Russia does not come into conflict with the WTO rules in future . 
There are also problems , however , in the area of the still unimplemented agreement from 2006 in respect of EU airlines . 
Relations between the EU and Russia are further strained by the planned US missile defences in Romania . 
If the EU is serious about its strategies for improving relations with Russia , then it must firstly resolve these problems and secondly , give consideration to Russian sensitivities relating to an historical sphere of influence that undoubtedly exists , or which exists as far as Russia is concerned . 
That is the only way we will make any progress . 
(PL) Madam President , the partnership between the European Union and Russia entails responsibility , including towards third countries . 
I would like to draw the Commission ' s attention to the paragraph of the resolution which calls on Russia not to use the supply of energy resources as a tool for influencing its neighbours ' policies . 
This is what has happened in the case of Ukraine , where Mr Putin , the Russian Prime Minister , said quite openly during his last meeting with Mr Azarov , the Ukrainian Prime Minister , that lower prices would only be offered and the gas contract renegotiated if Ukraine entered into a customs union with Russia , Belarus and Kazakhstan , which would mean abandoning its European plans and aspirations . 
This is nothing short of blackmail . 
If the contract is not renegotiated , gas prices on the Russia-Ukraine border may reach EUR 500 per 1 000 m3 . 
Ukraine is already paying the highest prices in Europe for Russian gas , although it is closest to the sources of this gas . 
This situation may result in a very serious economic and social crisis in Ukraine . 
I would like to make it clear that the European Union has obligations towards Ukraine , given that we are currently successfully negotiating the country ' s entry into a free trade area or the creation of such an area , and will , in the near future , engage in relations with it as an ally of the European Union . 
I would call on the Commission to demand quite plainly that Russia ceases all such practices and puts a stop to them . 
Madam President , yet another EU-Russia Summit is taking place this week . 
Major changes have occurred in the world since the last one . 
Let me mention among them , firstly , the Arab revolutions , a process of deep transformation which affects virtually the whole Arab world . 
The disaster at the Fukushima nuclear power plant reshaped the future of nuclear power , especially with regard to safety . 
Climate change has brought more and more dangerous consequences . 
Osama is dead but terrorism is alive and has targeted innocent people all over the world . 
The list of events is long and all of them concern both the EU and Russia , two neighbouring global players with predominantly similar or complementary long-term interests . 
Their relations can only be further developed if they are based on mutual respect , openness and transparency . 
Any hidden agenda has the potential to distort , if not destroy , these relations . 
The EU and Parliament have always been clear about the expectations of European citizens . 
Now , with regard to the upcoming summit , I would like to highlight four issues . 
First of all , the summit should bring decisive progress on all the remaining obstacles related to Russia ' s accession to the WTO . 
This important step will create better opportunities for the business communities on both sides and will further liberalise trade and economic relations globally . 
In this respect , the application of protectionist measures is counterproductive and we hope they will not be hidden behind overplayed health threats , which is , in our opinion , the recent case with the ban on imports of vegetables from the EU . 
We hope that the road map for visa-free travelling announced in May will accelerate further visa facilitation and will bring closer the moment when the visa regime between the EU and Russia will be fully liberalised . 
To this end , Parliament expects that some politically sensitive issues will be properly addressed by the Russian authorities , in particular , by stopping the issuing of Russian passports to the residents of South Ossetia and Abkhazia . 
I would like to see a more constructive engagement of Russia in our efforts to support democratisation , economic and social progress and stability in the six countries in the Eastern Partnership . 
The last two years have clearly shown that this EU initiative is not aimed at competition , but rather at cooperation with Russia , since the stable and self-confident common neighbourhood is in the interests of both the EU and Russia . 
In this respect , we urge Russia to intensify its efforts in facilitating the peaceful resolution of the conflicts in Transnistria and in the more and more worrying Nagorno-Karabakh region . 
Finally , I would like to mention that the EU and Russia should fully cooperate in the revision and elaboration of higher standards for nuclear power safety , following the events in Japan . 
We expect that higher standards are kept , not only in the newly built , but also in the already operational , nuclear power plants . 
I hope that this issue can be part of the discussions in Nizhny Novgorod . 
Madam President , Canada ' s Prime Minister , Pierre Trudeau , likened sharing a border with the USA to sharing a bed with an elephant . 
Our Union must share its bed with a bear . 
We must continue to try to develop relations in the context of the four common spaces and on the basis of last year ' s Partnership for Modernisation . 
As the Commissioner said , the last two years have seen improvements . 
The agreement on a gas advisory forum and the improved early warning mechanism are among these . 
Progress this month in solving the Transnistria conflict would be another positive step . 
However , as Baroness Ashton said last month after the Khodorkovsky / Lebedev judgment , and as the European Court on Human Rights has concluded on many occasions , real progress requires respect for democracy and human rights and a stable and fair legal framework for business , which are too often absent in Russia . 
A structured civil society dialogue would help; common action to fight climate change would help to build trust . 
But the Russian bear still has a sore head and I advise the Commission to carry to Nizhny Novgorod not only a jar of honey but also a large net . 
(CS) Madam President , Commissioner , as you are surely aware , Russia is a self-confident state and the Russians are a self-confident nation . 
The relationship between the EU and Russia must take the form of a genuine partnership , and not just a feigned partnership . 
Since we have excellent relations with the countries of the Eastern Partnership , relations between the EU and Russia must be at least on the same level . 
I am therefore delighted that , in your speech , you did not forget to mention the importance of abolishing the visa requirement with Russia , as relations between partners must be built on trust and openness . 
We should tell Russia clearly and seriously what the timetable is for abolishing visas , and what conditions must therefore be fulfilled . 
Commissioner , I would like to thank you for remembering , when preparing the joint EU-Russia Summit , all of the agendas that are important for the partnership between the EU and Russia . 
(NL) Madam President , first of all , a very urgent issue . 
I trust that this EU-Russia Summit will firmly address the very harmful and utterly disproportionate import ban on our European vegetables . 
The market gardening sector expects this ban to be lifted and deserves to see that happen . 
Commissioner Füle , can you confirm that the EU delegation will fully commit itself to resolving this situation in Nizhny Novgorod ? 
This is a very important question and one that I get asked a lot in my country at the moment when I talk about the EU-Russia Summit . 
I wanted to say a few words , in particular , about the problematic accession of Russia to the WTO . 
Just one more brief question . 
Georgia has , in fact , played a key role here . 
Georgia has de facto the right of veto . 
President Saakashvili is raising the stakes . 
What he wants are transparent borders - he basically wants Abkhazia and South Ossetia back - and he has , of course , also put the import ban on Georgian wines and mineral water on the agenda . 
However , Russia does not seem to be budging at all . 
In brief , is it not the case that we have deadlock on our hands here ? 
It very much looks like it . 
Besides , the Russian economy , which is mainly driven by oil and gas , does not really need accession to the WTO . 
(LT) Madam President , I call on the heads of the EU institutions not to forget human rights at the EU-Russia Summit that begins tomorrow . 
It is clear that respect for human rights is a valuable basis , without which a strategic partnership and the modernisation of EU-Russian relations would be impossible . 
The specific case we need to discuss is the ruling by Moscow city court on 24 May to reject the appeal made by Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev against the new seven year sentence . 
In the 21st century , a shameful trial is taking place before our very eyes , and the sentences are not written in court . 
This is happening in a country linked to the EU by a so-called strategic partnership . 
The ruling by the Moscow court once again revealed serious flaws in Russia ' s court system and strengthened the opinion that it punishes those in Russia who have political ambitions , but whose opinions do not coincide with those of the Kremlin . 
The ruling made on 31 May by the European Court of Human Rights and violations in Russia of the European Convention on Human Rights are facts that must also be discussed . 
We , the European Parliament should say clearly that , if Russia ' s President , Dmitri Medvedev , wants to come to the European Parliament , he should appear here together with prisoner of conscience , Mikhail Khodorkovsky , and this would be the most effective strategy and tactic for the modernisation of Russia . 
President Medvedev and prisoner of conscience , Mikhail Khodorkovsky , together in the European Parliament - that would be a sight worth not only the attention of the world ' s media , but also the heartfelt support of democratic society . 
(LT) Madam President , this summit is special because it takes place against the backdrop of the forthcoming elections in Russia . 
We expect Brussels to send Russia a strong signal about the elections respecting democratic standards , which would safeguard diversity of opinion in the Duma . 
The question of nuclear safety is particularly relevant following Fukushima . 
I am pleased that the Member of the Commission mentioned that this issue will be raised at the summit and that there will be a call for the highest international safety standards in nuclear power plants already operating and those that are planned , in both Russia , and of course , the European Union . 
I feel that EU and Russian relations with Belarus should also be discussed . 
A convergence of positions would help to open the prison gates for those who recently stood in the Belarusian elections and would stop blatant human rights abuses . 
I very much support those fellow Members who said that we need to translate words into deeds in the area of visa facilitation , and not just with Russia , but all of the European Union ' s eastern neighbours . 
As it assumes the EU Presidency , Poland has already found roads to a more fruitful dialogue with Russia , so that we can expect concrete steps to be taken in EU-Russia relations in the coming six months . 
(PL) Our most serious failings in relations between the EU and Russia are inconsistency , weakness and a lack of awareness of our own power . 
The Nord Stream issue is typical in this respect . 
First , we make energy solidarity one of Europe ' s leading principles in the Treaty of Lisbon , and then the EU agrees to the Nord Stream project , which is harmful to Poland and the other new Member States in geopolitical terms . 
We should therefore stand our ground when discussing each of the issues on the forthcoming agenda as outlined by the Commissioner . 
Russia must observe certain rules as regards the WTO . 
They should first allow Georgian wine onto their market before dreaming of WTO membership . 
As far as visas are concerned , Russia must be told that the visa regime will be liberalised for countries participating in the Eastern Partnership first , and for Russia only afterwards . 
The Kaliningrad Oblast may represent an exception to this rule . 
As regards the energy sector , Russia must be told that we are opposed to the repeated blackmailing of Ukraine , and that we are opposed to the measures taken by Russian agencies of influence , attempting to belittle the extraction of shale gas in Poland and in Europe . 
This is a great opportunity to gain independence from Russia . 
Madam President , Russia has proclaimed a modernisation programme and some observers are speaking about a new perestroika . 
So far , unfortunately , there is no real progress . 
Analysts conclude that the priority of the current Russian élites is to keep the present system in place , trying not to allow external relations to have any impact on the domestic situation . 
It is therefore up to the EU to make one issue very clear . 
The success of the Partnership for Modernisation will be dependent on the Russian Government ' s willingness and capacity to provide for a truly independent judiciary and to implement the basic principles of the rule of law , transparency and reciprocity . 
If the EU will not address this crucial issue in a principled manner , hardly any progress can be expected . 
Today ' s International Herald Tribune writes: ' Russia can ' t have a modern economy until it has a genuine rule of law ' . 
The summit venue will be Nizhny Novgorod , in Soviet times , Gorky , where the key figure of Soviet conscience , Andrei Sakharov , was banished for many years . 
I call upon the Commission and our negotiators to follow the spirit of Andrei Sakharov and to remember the message of Sakharov Prize winner , Sergei Kovalev , in this hemicycle two years ago . 
Finally , the EU should stimulate and help Russia to come to terms with its totalitarian legacy . 
After 20 years , even Mr Medvedev had to admit that one cannot ignore the terrible and criminal heritage of Russian power . 
I recall the words of our colleague , Mr Swoboda , who yesterday asked for a full clearing up of Russian history , especially the atrocities of the Stalin era . 
We can help Russia come to terms with its past . 
(SK) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , Russia still requires a two-handed approach: on the one hand , firm demands for the fulfilment of democratic principles , but , at the same time , a rejection of Bush ' s well-honed anti-Russian policy . 
Russia certainly has no right to a sphere of influence . 
All former Soviet republics have the right to decide freely where they wish to belong . 
It surely has the right , however , to safety and international security . 
Such a sense of security would certainly liberalise the internal situation in Russia . 
It is necessary to draw Russia into global politics on the side of Europe , so that Russia can feel that it is an accepted partner in the creation of an international and democratic order . 
The Partnership for Modernisation must fulfil not only the state-monopoly ideas of the Russian Government , but should create an area for untrammelled industrial and scientific activity , as Mr Fleckenstein said in his analysis here . 
If we adopted a different approach to Russia along these lines , we might harbour the hidden hope that democratic processes would be liberated to a far greater extent in Russia , with a certainty and confidence that can then feed into European politics . 
I am keeping my fingers crossed that this will emerge from the forthcoming talks . 
(PL) Madam President , on the eve of the EU-Russia Summit , and in the context of negotiations on a new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement , it is important for the EU not only to speak with one voice , but to show Russia its unity and solidarity in practice . 
Energy solidarity is enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon , but Russia does not accept this principle , with the Nord Stream project being an obvious example of this attitude . 
We must not agree to attempts to isolate some of the EU ' s new Member States using the dividing wedge of the energy sector , and this should be clearly emphasised during the summit . 
We should also expect acknowledgement of the European ambitions of Georgia , Moldova and Ukraine , and that Russia will be called upon to stop putting political pressure on these countries . 
Furthermore , we should remember that Russia is a unique democracy with a very high rate of corruption . 
(LV) Madam President , the new European Union-Russia partnership agreement must be concrete and legally binding in all areas of cooperation . 
This is a justified demand because we cannot allow for the agreement to be a collection of general phrases . 
The European Union and Russia are mutually dependent . 
The European market is no less important to Russia than Russian gas is to us , and Russian economic modernisation plans are directly dependent on our technology and expertise . 
That is why our cooperation should be closely linked to improvements in the fields of human rights and the rule of law . 
The European Union is Russia ' s largest trading partner and main investor; that is why the new agreement must contain legally binding terms regarding investment . 
It is important to insist on the elimination of unilateral and unreasonable trade barriers . 
This relates to the Russia - Kazakhstan - Belarus customs union , as well as to the current embargo on European Union vegetables . 
Russia cannot be allowed to continue using energy policy to implement its geopolitical interests , by discriminating against certain Member States , for example in the field of gas tariffs . 
Commissioner , in continuing to work on the visa-free zone with Russia , we must also work on establishing a visa-free zone with the rest of our Eastern Partnership states . 
At the summit , we must reiterate that the six-point agreement on Georgia has still not been implemented . 
Taking into account the upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections , the restrictions placed on opposition members regarding registration for the elections and on appearing in the mass media must be removed . 
We have already affirmed our willingness to be present in all phases of the election process , yet Russia must show willingness to accept long-term observers , as well as to actually implement fair elections . 
In conclusion , I should like to emphasise that these critical remarks are not in any way directed against Russia or its people , but the opposite - they are directed against the current government , in order to improve the situation in Russia and make our cooperation more fruitful . 
(RO) Madam President , global warming , drug trafficking , the non-proliferation of weapons and energy security are common challenges requiring global solutions . 
This is why we need to build a solid partnership with Russia based on mutual trust . 
I would like to welcome the resumption of negotiations for an ambitious new partnership agreement in an attempt to overcome past tensions . 
I think that Russia must be supported by the European Union in its efforts to join the WTO , as this will boost trade and economic relations between the two partners and encourage investment . 
At the same time , during tomorrow ' s summit , the High Representative must urge Russia to ratify the Energy Charter because proper energy cooperation cannot exist between the European Union and Russia unless the principles of transparency , reciprocity , competitiveness and non-discrimination are observed . 
(PL) Madam President , Commissioner , I expect that modernisation will be one of the issues discussed during the summit . 
I would merely like to remind you that modernising Russia is not merely a matter of economic or energy issues , but also a matter of political modernisation and relations between the authorities and society . 
I would ask you to raise this issue . 
This also involves relations between Russia and its neighbours , and Russia ' s ' sphere of influence ' . 
Since you are conducting relations with Ukraine so very successfully , I would urge you to make it very clear that an association agreement between the European Union and Ukraine will also be beneficial to Russia , and that we are very alarmed at the manifestations of extremely forceful political pressure being brought to bear on Ukraine on the eve of the conclusion of negotiations , while these negotiations are in their final stages . 
Please make this very clear to the Russian side on our behalf . 
These are very important factors contributing to mutual trust between the European Union institutions and the Member States , on the one hand , and Russia , on the other . 
(DE) Madam President , firstly , may I say that I was astonished to hear a man such as Mr Mölzer , who is well educated in history , say that there are historical zones of Russian influence in Europe and that this includes parts of the European Union such as Romania . 
The days of the Hitler-Stalin pact are long gone and in a democratic world , we should be practising a kind of European Monroe Doctrine; in other words , that the fate and the policies of Europe are decided by Europeans . 
That does not mean that we do not want a policy of good neighbourliness and dialogue . 
Yet Nizhny Novgorod - the venue for our meeting - should also serve as a warning , because it reminds us of the famous story of the merchants of Nizhny Novgorod who believed that they could buy their freedom and their security and were then hanged . 
We have to realise that we cannot buy security with money or by glossing over reality; it is only obtainable through honest partnership . 
We need a common foreign affairs and security policy . 
We need energy independence and energy security and less dependence on Russian energy policy , which is still being used for foreign policy purposes . 
We also need to speak clearly on human rights . 
We cannot afford to compromise here . 
Where Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev are concerned , I would state that these individuals must at last be freed - otherwise the state visit by the Russian President to the European Parliament will take place under a huge cloud . 
We want to have a partnership with a Russia that is in the process of democratising , but to do that , Russia must democratise - in reality and not just in our wishful thinking . 
That is why I think Mr Swoboda is right: the forthcoming elections will be decisive . 
Then we will see whether our partnership with the Russian people - of whom we are very fond - can be expanded into a genuine partnership with the Russian state . 
(FI) Madam President , as Mr Posselt also said , Europe needs Russia and Russia needs Europe . 
Cooperation between Europe and Russia is important for promoting political , social and economic stability , not just in Europe but worldwide . 
It is regrettable that the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and Russia does not meet today ' s needs for cooperation . 
We should make the strategic partnership closer , deeper and broader . 
The basis for all EU-Russia relations in future , however , needs to be the promotion of peace and security and support for democratic values and political and economic freedom . 
The Partnership for Modernisation should be deepened and made more focused , but mere political dialogue between diplomats is simply not enough . 
We must do everything we can to make it easier for people to meet and increase cooperation in the areas of science , art , culture , education and enterprise . 
(PL) Madam President , there will no doubt be a great many issues covered during the EU-Russia Summit , but one of the most important is anticipated to be the issue of energy security . 
For several months , Russia has been conducting a very intensive campaign aimed at obtaining exemptions for its gas infrastructure from the rules set out in the third energy package , or , in other words , the rules of our anti-monopoly law , which prohibit the simultaneous and parallel control of energy resources and transmission networks . 
Mr Shmatko , the Russian Energy Minister , Mr Kramer , CEO of the South Stream project , and Mr Miller , CEO of Gazprom , have made visits to Brussels in connection with this matter . 
This is a major campaign . 
The European Union ' s position on this matter must be set out very clearly to Russia , namely , that we do not intend to grant reduced tariffs to Russia; instead , what matters to us is that the gas market in Central Europe becomes more competitive and less monopolised . 
Commissioner , I would ask you to tell us plainly whether the European Commission is prepared to make statements to this effect during the summit . 
(PL) Madam President , in the run-up to the forthcoming summit , we really can say that the European Union lacks a single coherent strategy as regards Russia , and that the current policy of pragmatic cooperation based on a strategy of small steps may very easily fall apart during whatever crisis occurs next , as was the case in 2008 during the war with Georgia , or in 2009 after gas supplies were cut off . 
In the context of the latter event , it is very important to emphasise the definition of the word ' diversification ' , which in Europe is often synonymous with the construction of a large number of different gas pipelines from Russia . 
Diversification is taken to mean the construction of the South and Nord Stream gas pipelines , for example . 
Meanwhile , the European Union should concentrate on guaranteeing gas supplies from non-Russian sources: it should do more to promote the Nabucco pipeline from Azerbaijan , and it should invest in gas terminals and research into extracting shale gas . 
It is also very important that pressure continues to be put upon the Russian authorities at various levels to improve the human rights situation in Russia . 
Apart from discussion in the framework of the EU-Russia summits , we should ensure that the consultations which take place twice yearly with European Union representatives and diplomats from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs are decisively stepped up . 
(PL) Madam President , I believe that the Russian authorities should be told that we expect them to behave responsibly . 
Russia is potentially a very important partner for the European Union , for example , when it comes to finding a solution to certain frozen conflicts in Europe which remain unresolved . 
I believe that the Russian authorities should be told that although vegetables and gas are important , they must stop supporting Transnistrian separatists , that we expect them to stop supplying weapons to Azerbaijan and Armenia , since this poses a great risk for the future of this region , and that we also expect Russia to fulfil its obligations under the agreement on Georgia concluded in 2008 . 
We expect that Russian forces will be withdrawn from Abkhazia and South Ossetia , and we expect that Russia will respect Georgia ' s right to consider and decide its own future . 
(PL) Madam President , although I agree with Mr Lisek ' s statements on Georgia , and not forgetting what many MEPs have said about Ukraine , it seems to me that at tomorrow ' s summit , we must also spare a few words - or a great many words - for Belarus . 
I would ask everyone to remember that we have been dealing for many months with a very far-reaching political crisis there , and that for at least several months , we have been dealing with a far-reaching economic crisis . 
We are also dealing with a situation in which Russia is putting pressure on Belarus , probably a great deal more forcefully and effectively than it currently is on Ukraine . 
Russia is effectively attempting to take over the entire economy , or rather strategic sectors of the economy , by taking advantage of the dramatic situation in which the Belarusian economy finds itself . 
I have one request . 
If Russia decides to provide aid , and we know that it has decided to provide aid to Belarus , the European Union should ensure that Russia makes this aid dependent on the observance of human rights . 
These are common values that we apparently share with Russia , a fact which is often repeated by the Russians , and so they should help us to introduce these values in Belarus . 
Otherwise , by funding the Lukashenko regime , we will be responsible for it . 
(SK) Madam President , we always have a number of problematic issues on hand for negotiations with Russia , such as the standard of civil rights , the nonsensical ban on imports of vegetables from the EU , the anti-missile shield located in the EU , or the problematic involvement of Russia in many former Soviet republics . 
I do not want to say that we should avoid talking about these difficult topics , but I firmly believe that we should not limit ourselves to them . 
We should also bring new ideas for mutually beneficial cooperation . 
European producers need new opportunities to sell their products . 
Russia is an enormous trade area , with ever increasing purchasing power . 
It is therefore necessary to work more intensively to eliminate the obstacles that are holding back trade cooperation , and also jointly to support projects such as the extension of the broad-gauge railway line running from the Pacific to the heart of the EU . 
Projects such as this can create new impulses for cooperation , the implementation of which will bring benefits not only to Europe , but also to Ukraine , Russia and many Asian countries . 
(PL) Madam President , talks are being held between the European Union and Russia on the future of the energy sector , but from what I understand , a new group is currently being set up , which will debate the third energy package in the context of gas security . 
I would like to call on Commissioner Füle , and on Commissioner Oettinger , to provide the European Parliament with information regarding the progress of the talks and the outcome of this group ' s negotiations . 
We would also like a list of the members of the negotiating group . 
I learnt from a representative of a Russian energy concern that the company would be participating in these negotiations . 
I would like to know whether this is true , and whether the representatives of large companies will take part in negotiations on the Russian side . 
Compliance with competition law in the field of energy , without the granting of any exemptions , is also a very important matter for the European Parliament . 
During the recent presentations of South Stream investment plans in Brussels , it was apparent that Russia and Gazprom want privileges and a special status . 
We cannot agree to this . 
Madam President , I see Parliament ' s resolution as Europe ' s hand extended to the Russia of today which needs , despite all its baseless pride and inherited arrogance , a really friendly advice and action plan . 
As the Human Rights Consultations advising President Medvedev have called for an essential renovation of the national house from basement to roof , our Parliament is coming not with empty appeasement but with constructive provision of cooperation . 
The greatest chance appears there if Russia is open and striving to build an open society , not one that is closed in backward Stalinism . 
Unfortunately , Russia ' s pressure on the rest of the G8 to accept the occupied territories of Georgia in the WTO system on the side of Russia does not testify to their really good will . 
If it is true that the West has consented to this , it is unfortunately thus showing its weakness just before the Nizhny Novgorod Summit . 
(DE) Madam President , Russia is no doubt an important partner for the European Union , but a very difficult one . 
Accession to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) is undoubtedly of great importance to Russia . 
However , I would like to call explicitly for a democratic process at both a political level and at the level of civil society . 
It is absolutely essential that human rights are respected and observed . 
(RO) Madam President , the EU-Russia Summit is taking place against the background of regional developments which influence this partnership . 
Reform of the European Neighbourhood Policy may help resolve the conflict in Transnistria . 
Indeed , Russia has shown an interest in setting up a joint political committee . 
However , the structure and deadline for setting up this body are due to be discussed . 
The food crisis which is affecting Europe at the moment has brought trade with Russia to a halt . 
New negotiations on current sanitary regulations could improve this situation . 
Russia ' s membership of the WTO will have a long-term impact on economic relations with the EU . 
This is why all the relevant agreements need to be revised . 
The energy issue is another topic of interest , as a result of launching the AGRI project . 
This would offer an alternative source to that provided by the Nabucco project . 
Madam President , it is good that the European Union should strive to have the best possible relations with all its neighbours , and indeed with all countries around the world . 
Sometimes , that can be difficult - particularly , I suppose , when it comes to Russia , because it has a very chequered history . 
Even since the fall of the Iron Curtain over 20 years ago , its behaviour towards some countries , particularly neighbours such as Georgia , certainly cannot be admired . 
Obviously , any negotiations with Russia have to be underpinned by a recognition of the important values of respect for human rights and respect for neighbours . 
Nevertheless , they do offer a great opportunity for tackling global issues like climate change and also , of course , a great opportunity to develop both our economies . 
Russia is a rising country and a developing country in terms of wealth . 
Certainly , if the fundamentals are right , there are great opportunities both for the European Union and for Russia in the long term . 
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , today ' s exchange of views was indeed very useful for adding a final touch to our summit preparations and you can rest assured that I will convey the key messages to the High Representative and Vice-President Ashton who will debrief the Presidents and Commissioner Karel De Gucht . 
I have heard many of you calling for continuing engagement with Russia , calling for the relationship and coordination with the Russian Federation to be further developed , but I also heard calls for more democracy and less corruption . 
I also heard a call for no harassment , which was reported in Nizhny Novgorod , although I respect the role of the Russian Federation in ensuring security for the summit . 
We have seen that we have convergent views on many subjects . 
We agree on the key importance of our relations with Russia both bilaterally and in multilateral contexts , whether regional or global . 
We agree that it is a multifaceted relationship in which economic , social and environmental issues , human rights and rule of law , security aspects and political cooperation are all of paramount importance . 
We should not expect a resolution of all pending problems at this summit - and yes , we will raise the issue of vegetables . 
But we should aim to make significant progress in a number of areas . 
Let me comment on some of these areas . 
First: elections . 
The Russian authorities are well aware that the European Union will be following the 2011 and 2012 electoral processes very closely . 
Should there be irregularities in the upcoming elections , these issues would have to be addressed . 
Right now , we are calling on Russia to respect obligations it has undertaken in the context of the Council of Europe , the United Nations and the OSCE regarding free and fair elections , and to cooperate well with ODIHR to ensure appropriate monitoring . 
We will place a special emphasis on the issue of the registration of new parties and access to the electoral process . 
Second: I took note of Parliament ' s concerns with regard to the human rights situation in Russia; we share most of them and these issues will be raised with the Russian President at the summit . 
The main forum for addressing human rights and rule-of-law issues is the European Union-Russia human rights consultations . 
This is an important instrument and its potential should be fully used . 
Unfortunately , this is not yet the case and the European Union will therefore stress the need to have an honest and useful dialogue for which a review of the consultations ' modalities is necessary . 
Third: the Partnership for Modernisation . 
I fully agree with the honourable Members that the Partnership for Modernisation should be broadly based . 
The coordinators will present in Nizhny Novgorod the second programme report on the implementation of the partnership and , as you will see , the rule of law is at the very core of this initiative and we have concrete projects in this area . 
Point four: Russia is the neighbour of our neighbours , and I think Nizhny Novgorod would be an excellent opportunity to refer to the recently adopted ENP review document and , with reference to this document , to make sure that we are transparent in our policy vis-à-vis the neighbours we share with Russia . 
This is an opportunity - based inter alia on that transparency - to make our point that caring about the well-being of the neighbours we share is a win-win process . 
I think it will also be a good opportunity , based on some new ideas in that ENP review , to talk about a strengthened cooperation to address the protracted conflicts in our neighbourhood . 
Point five: the question of energy cooperation will be addressed at the summit . 
We need transparent , fair and competitive energy relations and we will raise our concerns with the Russian President . 
We will emphasise the need for further reforms , as I stressed in my opening remarks , in the Russian electricity and gas sector with a view to establishing a level playing field . 
Madam President , honourable Members , the European Union and Russia are partners . 
Partners should talk to each other frequently , they should try to achieve consensus where possible , but should not hesitate to openly address more problematic aspects . 
We have talked about some of these problematic aspects today . 
They should be addressed at the summit and , wherever possible , we should look for solutions or at least improvement . 
I have already mentioned the ENP review . 
I strongly believe that one of the added values of that reviewed Neighbourhood Policy is that the universally applicable values and principles reflected there are not only applicable to small and medium-sized neighbouring countries . 
I have received six motions for resolution tabled in accordance with Rule 110(2) of the Rules of Procedure . 
The debate is closed . 
The vote will take place tomorrow (9 June 2011) . 
Written statements (Rule 149)
I am pleased to be one of those signing this resolution , which reaffirms the importance of respect for democracy and human rights in relations between the European Union and Russia . 
Starting with the Russia-EU dialogue on human rights and continuing with the summits , I think that a systematic and honest approach is required in cases where the standards for a fair trial are not respected or human rights activists or journalists are persecuted and prevented from doing their job . 
Furthermore , clear reference criteria need to be introduced regarding Russia ' s respect for democratic standards , which will help deepen relations with the EU . 
Lastly , we must not forget either the support which needs to be given in developing civil society , as the guarantor of a democracy which will not only stick to procedures but be truly inclusive as well .

Order of business
Mrs Oomen-Ruijten has asked for the floor . 
on behalf of the PPE Group . - (NL) Mr President , we discussed Russia in our last part-session . 
At the time , we sent messages to the President of the Commission and the President-in-Office of the Council telling them to discuss the Russian elections . 
We have now been informed that one party in Russia has been denied registration . 
On the other hand , the OSCE has informed us that they have been permitted to send observers to oversee the elections . 
We would like to receive a statement on the state of affairs in Russia as soon as possible . 
We also want to have a debate on this . 
I think that would be appropriate . 
on behalf of the S&D Group . - (DE) Mr President , I would like to endorse this motion . 
However , it is up to the Conference of Presidents , as a sign of political will , to allow us also to have a brief statement and a debate on this matter in the July part-session , when the High Representative will also be here . 
We are not having a debate now . 
We take note of this request and will pass it on to the relevant bodies . 
We now move on to the order of business . 
The final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of 9 June 2011 pursuant to Rules 137 and 138 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed . 
Having consulted with the political groups , I would like to submit to the House the following proposed amendments to the final version of the draft agenda:
Thursday 23 June 2011
1 . 
The vote on the report by Mr Kastler on the European Year for Active Ageing (2012) is postponed to the July part-session . 
2 . 
The report by Mr Tatarella on tractors placed on the market under the flexibility scheme will be included directly in the vote . 
The deadline for tabling amendments is at 16:00 today . 
Are there any comments ? 
There are no comments , so these amendments are accepted . 
In addition , the following changes have been requested:
The Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance has requested that today , on Wednesday 22 June 2011 , the debate on economic governance take place immediately after the debate on preparations for the European Council meeting and before the Dess report on the common agricultural policy . 
(The amendment was rejected)
We shall now move on to the order of business for Thursday . 
The Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left has asked to postpone to a later part-session the vote on the reports included in the joint debate on economic governance (Ferreira , Feio , Ford , Goulard , Wortmann-Kool and Haglund . 
Mr Klute has the floor to present the request . 
Mr President , I would like to move that we postpone the debate and the vote on economic governance to the July part-session . 
Our reasons for wanting to do so are quite simple . 
The Ecofin Council met on Monday and once again made amendments to the compromises that had been negotiated . 
As MEPs we have not had sufficient time to have a proper look at these . 
The necessary translations were not available , either . 
We see this as unacceptable pressure being exerted by the Council and would ask you as fellow Members to resist this pressure and to vote in favour of the motion to postpone the debate and vote . 
on behalf of the PPE Group . - Mr President , Europe urgently needs a strong foundation for the euro . 
We have been discussing this package for many months and now there is 98% agreement with the Council . 
We would like to have the vote tomorrow so that Parliament can express its views in a vote in plenary . 
Further negotiations with the Council are needed so we can get a final agreement before summer in order to have a strong foundation for the euro . 
Mr President , we are looking at a package that has had last-minute changes made to it by the Economic and Financial Affairs Council , which have not yet been translated into the various languages . 
First of all , there is only one version - at least , I have only had access to an English version - which does not give us an exact picture of what happened . 
The second issue is that the facts involved are vitally important and the consequences are very serious for our countries and our peoples , not least bearing in mind the situations that are now being experienced here in the European Union , for instance in Greece and Ireland and , as is being announced , Portugal . 
We therefore think a more careful approach to these issues is required . 
That is why we insist that we need to put off voting on them until July . 
The request is rejected . 
The order of business is thus adopted . 
Preparations for the European Council meeting (24 June 2011) (debate)
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the preparations for the European Council meeting of 23-24 June 2011 . 
President-in-Office of the Council . - Mr President , President of the Commission , honourable Members , this is the last occasion I have to address this House on behalf of the Council in a plenary debate . 
In January , we promised to run a Parliament-friendly Presidency . 
Aware of the consequences of the Lisbon Treaty , we realised that close cooperation with the European Parliament and its members would be essential for the success of any Presidency in the future . 
The European public looks to the EU for results , without bothering too much with distinguishing between Parliament , Commission and Council . 
And they are right in doing so . 
We have a common responsibility and therefore our success or failure is shared . 
The forthcoming European Council marks the end of the Hungarian Presidency . 
Therefore , this debate is a golden opportunity to give an account of what it has achieved on a number of dossiers , in close cooperation with this House . 
Let me start with economic policy . 
The European Council will bring the first European Semester to a conclusion . 
It brings together in one policy cycle the two arms of economic recovery: financial stability that is based on fiscal consolidation , reflected in stability and convergence programmes , and structural reforms for a smart , sustainable , socially-inclusive and job-creating growth . 
Thanks to the excellent cooperation between Commission , Council and Member States in handling national reform programmes and recommendations , the first European Semester has lasted a semester , and not a day longer . 
The European Council will be invited to endorse the country-specific recommendations approved by the Council , which should be reflected by all Member States in their national decisions as regards their budgets and structural reforms . 
Even in the trialogue negotiations , we included a reference to the European semester so that Parliament could be duly informed of these developments . 
Regarding the Euro Plus Pact , most of the Member States participating have presented commitments amounting to more than a hundred separate measures in total . 
Those commitments are a good step towards achieving the objectives of the Pact , which must now be implemented at the national level . 
However , the degree of ambition and precision of these initial commitments is uneven . 
In preparing their next commitments , Member States will ensure a broader scope , a more concrete approach and a higher degree of ambition . 
Allow me now to turn to the six legislative proposals on economic governance , called the ' six-pack ' in our common jargon . 
I will not go into detail as it is on the plenary agenda in its own right . 
Let me just remind you that the Hungarian Presidency was given a mandate by the European Council to reach political agreement with Parliament by the end of June . 
After the adoption of a general approach by the Council in March , we got down to business immediately , engaging in intense trialogue negotiations with Parliament and the Commission . 
The three institutions have done immense work . 
The initial position of Parliament carried approximately 2 000 amendments . 
By now , we have managed to reduce the outstanding issues to one single major issue and some technicalities . 
I am convinced that the text we have on the table now is stronger and more suited to preventing future crises . 
We will inform the President of the European Council accordingly , thus reporting back to the body which gave us this mission . 
I have been personally involved in fascinating talks with many members of this House . 
I take this opportunity to thank you all sincerely for this experience . 
As a Parliament-friendly Presidency , we hope that the results which have brought us to the verge of agreement will not be wasted . 
The financial markets , European business and , most importantly , our fellow European citizens , expect us to show responsibility and decide and act against indebtedness - the chief predicament of our economies . 
Finally , we know too that the issue of Greece will be also on the agenda of the European Council . 
Let me now turn to Justice and Home Affairs . 
The European Council will address strategic issues relating to asylum , migration and Schengen; building on the conclusions adopted by the Justice and Home Affairs Council of 9 June 2011 . 
In the light of recent developments , the European Council will discuss ideas and provide more political guidance and cooperation in the Schengen area . 
It will also discuss ideas as regards a possible safeguard mechanism . 
But let me stress that the good functioning of Schengen requires Member States to fully implement the rules and thus enhance mutual trust among themselves . 
It also requires an effective and updated monitoring and evaluation system . 
Let me touch upon the free movement of persons . 
It belongs to a different chapter of the acquis comunautaire than Schengen , yet they are inextricably linked . 
Both belong to the most visible and popular achievements of European integration . 
The Member States are aware of this and fully intend to safeguard them . 
The logic behind Schengen is unchanged: ever more efficient management of the external border is the precondition for travelling without border controls within the Schengen zone . 
As you know , there have been intensive negotiations on the Frontex Amending Regulation . 
We have in Frontex a European tool par excellence which is essential for controlling our external borders . 
The Presidency welcomes the positive result of the most recent trialogue meeting . 
Member States are discussing the results this afternoon and we are optimistic that an agreement can be reached in time for the European Council . 
Regarding the European Asylum policy: recent developments have put this under strain . 
Safe and efficient asylum procedures are required for people in need of protection . 
It is therefore crucial for the Common European Asylum System to be completed by 2012 - a system based on high protection standards combined with fair and effective procedures capable of preventing abuse and allowing for rapid examination of asylum applications in order to ensure its sustainability . 
The European Council will also review the progress on the preparation of the plans for capacity development to manage migration flows and refugee flows . 
The objective must be to address the root causes of irregular migration . 
To that end , partnerships will be developed with Southern Neighbourhood countries . 
As a first step , a wide-ranging structured dialogue on migration , mobility and security will be established with those countries , with the aim of securing tangible benefits for them as well as for the EU . 
Let me now say some words on Croatia . 
Closing the accession negotiations with Croatia was listed among the top priorities of our Presidency . 
As a result of the tremendous efforts made by Croatia , the Commission and the Presidency with the essential support of this House - for which it deserves immense credit - the European Council will call for the conclusion of the accession negotiations with Croatia by the end of June 2011 . 
The signing of the Accession Treaty before the end of the year is being envisaged . 
These developments bring a new momentum to the European perspective of the Western Balkans . 
The European Council will return to this matter at its December 2011 meeting . 
In this context , it is expected to welcome the arrest of General Mladić and his transfer to The Hague . 
Serbia has taken a giant step towards EU accession . 
Regarding the Southern Neighbourhood: the European Council is expected to endorse the new approach to relations with the EU neighbours which was agreed at Monday ' s Foreign Affairs Council . 
Given the serious developments in parts of the Union ' s southern neighbourhood , the European Council is also expected to adopt a declaration on recent events in the region . 
Among other issues , let me inform you that the European Council is expected to appoint Mario Draghi as the next Governor of the European Central Bank on whom this house takes a vote . 
Last but not least , the European Council is likely to endorse the EU Strategy for the Danube Region and the EU Framework of National Roma Integration Strategies , thus realising two further priorities of the Hungarian Presidency . 
The Danube Strategy is designed to enhance opportunities for an entire region that embraces a diversity of Member States and third countries in the Western Balkans - nations , peoples and communities alike . 
With the EU Framework of National Roma Integration Strategies , we will tackle the plight of the Roma people for the first time at European level and turn it into an opportunity for all of us . 
A special thanks to this House for producing such an excellent report - the Járóka report - and the decision , which was an excellent base for our work in the Council . 
Europe thus will show that , in the words of Prime Minister Orbán , it ' has a heart and not only a brain ' . 
Mr President , President of the Commission , honourable Members , the Hungarian Presidency chose ' Strong Europe ' as a motto . 
Let me express hope that you will agree with the judgment of President Buzek , who recently said ' after the Hungarian Presidency Europe will be stronger and better ' . 
Thank you again , from the bottom of my heart , for your cooperation in the last six months . 
President of the Commission . - Mr President , this week ' s European Council has a very substantive agenda . 
Minister Győri has presented the agenda in general , on behalf of the Hungarian Presidency of the Council . 
I wish to thank her , at this juncture , for the commitment shown over the course of these six months . 
Let me focus on some specific points: I have written a letter to the members of the European Council outlining the positions of the Commission on what I believe are the most important items on the agenda , and I would like to share our positions with you . 
At the end I will also make some comments regarding Greece . 
This European Council will take very important steps towards ensuring that the European Union ' s economic policy-making is both more coherent and more effective . 
Firstly , we have the economic governance package . 
I would like to thank this Parliament very sincerely for the extremely hard work and commitment it has shown in maintaining a high level of ambition on this issue . 
Later this afternoon , Commissioner Rehn , on behalf of the Commission , will express our detailed positions on these extremely important matters . 
Now I expect Parliament and the Member States to come to an agreement , because the adoption of the governance package is fundamental to our comprehensive response to the crisis . 
Agreement on this package is vital . 
It will be extremely difficult to explain to our citizens why we are not able to agree on the fundamental pillars of the response to this crisis when we are trying to respond to challenges of the current magnitude . 
I believe the agreement on this package will strengthen our economic surveillance mechanisms at European level . 
It will make the European Union far better placed to prevent the development of unsustainable public debt and deficits , and the emergence of harmful macroeconomic imbalances . 
Although prevention is better than cure , we will also be better placed to take action to correct these situations if they do emerge . 
Secondly , I expect the Heads of State and Government to endorse the country-specific recommendations that the Commission presented on 7 June . 
This is , as you know , the first time we are carrying out this kind of collective exercise at European level . 
The recommendations are based on an extensive analysis by the Commission of Member States ' plans for sustainable growth and job creation , married to sound public finances . 
They are focused , measurable and tailored to each country ' s most pressing challenges . 
Of course , discussions between the Commission and the Member States on these recommendations have sometimes been very intense , but I am pleased that the overall result has maintained the high level of ambition . 
We cannot reap the benefits of the single market on the one hand and ignore reckless economic policy-making on the other . 
There is no point in signing off on a brand new economic governance package if , the very same week , Member States question the methodology and independent Commission recommendations in the country-specific exercise . 
This new way of policy-making is also a strong appeal for collective responsibility , because the European Union ' s economic space is so much more than the sum of our different economies . 
Thirdly , the European Council is due to endorse the treaty change needed to allow for the establishment of the European Stability Mechanism in 2013 , with its capacity to assist - on the basis of strict conditionality - euro area Member States in financial difficulties . 
The ESM , combined with the increase of the effective lending capacity of the EFSF , is a clear demonstration of our commitment to safeguard the stability of the euro area on the basis of sound and sustainable public finances . 
You may remember that , in January when the Commission presented the annual growth survey , a very important topic was the need to reinforce the effective lending capacity of the EFSF . 
At that time we were very much criticised , but now - unanimously - the governments of Europe have decided to increase the effective lending capacity . 
I wonder if it would not have been possible to approve it some months ago . 
The economic governance package , country-specific recommendations and the stability mechanisms: this is how Europe should seriously draw the lessons from the crisis and act upon them . 
The Commission will do its utmost to maintain this level of steadfast resolve in all matters to be discussed . 
To respond to the economic crisis , every sector needs to contribute , and none more so than the financial sector . 
I have promised Parliament that the Commission will bring forward a formal legislative proposal on a financial tax . 
The proposal will have three aims . 
Firstly , to avoid fragmentation of the internal market for financial services , because there are an increasing number of uncoordinated national tax measures being put in place . 
Secondly , this financial tax also aims to create appropriate disincentives for overly-risky or purely speculative transactions . 
Thirdly , to ensure that financial institutions make a fair and substantive contribution to the sharing of the costs of the recent crisis , as well as to address concerns about excessive profits . 
The very high bonuses that are still being paid to bankers - bankers who have sometimes been saved thanks to huge amounts of taxpayers ' money - suggest that there are excessive profits in the banking sector and that the banking sector should also contribute to the common public good . 
(Applause)
The second major issue for the European Council is migration . 
The issue of migration has come to the fore in recent months , particularly under the pressure of recent events in the southern Mediterranean . 
I spoke to Parliament in May about the Commission ' s migration package , which sets recent and future policy initiatives in a framework that allows the EU and its Member States to manage asylum , migration and mobility of third-country nationals in a secure environment . 
Migration , let us face it , is a very emotive issue . 
But let me state clearly that the Commission will not accept any attempts to undermine the Schengen principles . 
In fact , I think that we will see exactly the opposite , through a reinforcement of the European approach to migration and free movement . 
The Commission has proposed strengthening the governance of the Schengen area , thereby reinforcing Member States ' confidence and trust in the effective management of our external borders . 
This will be done both through strengthening the Frontex border agency and through an evaluation mechanism whereby national border agencies will work jointly on assessing threats . 
We are also exploring the feasibility of a safeguard system which would allow the adoption of decisions at European level to confront possible difficult situations where our common external borders are subject to exceptional pressure or where Member States are failing to comply with their obligations to control their borders . 
Decisions on the best way to handle such situations should be taken at European Union level , avoiding unilateral action by Member States . 
As a last-resort mechanism , and if the critical situation justifies it , these decisions could make provision for the temporary reintroduction of internal border controls , but always within a Community framework . 
This does not mean rolling back the abolition of internal borders . 
This is a way of strengthening the European dimension of the system so that individual Member States do not feel pressured into acting unilaterally . 
I will be looking for clear backing for this approach from the European Council , so that detailed Commission proposals can be finalised and have an opportunity to succeed . 
The migration package is completed by proposals for a common , efficient and protective asylum system which guarantees asylum seekers equal treatment across the European Union . 
I am confident that Parliament and the Council will endorse the proposals set out in the Commission ' s reviewed proposals on minimum standards for the reception of asylum seekers and on refugee status . 
I will call on the European Council to lend its support to the completion of the entirety of the asylum package as quickly as possible within the agreed deadline . 
The European Council has also discussed the situation in our neighbourhood , in particular the implementation of the Partnership for Democracy and Shared Prosperity with the Southern Mediterranean . 
This partnership is extremely important to our Arab partners , who are looking to the European Union to support the democratic transitions in the southern Mediterranean . 
We must not let them down . 
Another item on the upcoming European Council agenda is the Commission ' s recommendation that Croatia become the 28th Member State of the European Union , hopefully by 1 July 2013 . 
There is still substantial work to be done , but I hope that at the end of the month we can sign off on the remaining chapters in the Accession Conference . 
Finally , a word about Greece , because I hope Member States will also have the occasion to discuss at the highest level this situation , which is important not only for a Member State of our Union but , I believe , for the stability of the euro area and for the stability of the European Union as a whole . 
The issue of Greece raises very important issues , not just in terms of financial stability , but also in terms of social commitment and in terms of the political determination of the European Union . 
Last night ' s vote in the Greek Parliament allows the government to build consensus in support of the reform package , agreed with the European Union and IMF , of fiscal measures , privatisations and reforms that are necessary in Greece ' s journey back to growth . 
Because , let us be absolutely clear , there is no alternative to this plan . 
So let us act upon it . 
I know that many people in Greece are living through a period of great hardship and uncertainty . 
My message to the Greek people is that if the government acts , Europe will deliver . 
If Greece can demonstrate that it is genuinely committed to the reform package agreed with the European Union and the IMF , we will accompany Greece on its journey back to growth . 
Fiscal consolidation is entirely necessary , but the goal is growth . 
We should never forget that one euro spent on interest rates to pay the debt is one euro that cannot go to the people of Greece , so it is critically important to reduce debt and to control the deficit so that we can restore confidence in the Greek economy , in order to promote growth . 
At the same time , it is extremely important that the Greek people understand that in the face of such difficult circumstances a national consensus is necessary: a national consensus and not short-sighted partisan politics . 
We need a national consensus in Greece so that Greece can win the confidence of the partners and the markets in terms of the very important reforms that are needed . 
(Applause)
On Monday night I met with Prime Minister Papandreou , and we also discussed a more strategic use of our European structural funds . 
Greece has the potential to access a significant amount of European funds under the cohesion policy . 
I believe we should increase their rate of absorption and accelerate those funds , aiming for a significant impact on improving competitiveness and employment . 
This will be done within the existing funds . 
It will be a comprehensive programme of technical assistance focused on growth and jobs , but with an emergency character because - I repeat - Greece is living in an emergency situation . 
I will discuss these issues with the European Council: what we can do together with Greece . 
We , the Commission , can put this in place , bilaterally with the government , but I believe efforts are necessary from all those that can contribute , namely in terms of technical assistance coming from different Member States . 
The Greek Government is ready to engage with us in this approach . 
I believe we should also be ready to react in a very positive way , always on the basis of strict conditionality regarding the necessary reforms for that country . 
The implementation of Greece ' s reform plans calls for exceptional efforts from the Greek people . 
The Commission is now proposing an exceptional response as a sign to the Greek people that there is hope . 
They are making sacrifices , and we know they are making sacrifices , but at the end of that road there is hope , and solutions are within their reach . 
They are making some important cuts , but those cuts are necessary for growth . 
Growth is the answer , and we will work with the Greek authorities and the Greek people to achieve that objective . 
Mr President , President of the Commission , President-in-Office of the Council , Minister Győri , I would firstly like to say a brief word to you , in acknowledgement of all the work you have done and especially of the methodical approach you employed and the hours you devoted to this work , with Parliament in particular . 
I think that is worth mentioning and so , once again , thank you . 
(Applause)
You are applauding her , but it could not have been any other way: we have trained her well within our group . 
Therefore , she knows what Parliament is all about . 
Seldom has a European Council meeting taken place in such difficult and tense circumstances . 
Seldom have expectations been so high among the people in our various countries , expectations of brave and united decisions from their leaders on the burning issue of the euro and the debt crisis , as well as on economic governance . 
In several countries , and especially in Greece , our fellow citizens are confused , anxious and deeply concerned about their and their children ' s future . 
I would like to take this opportunity to send out three messages to our Greek friends . 
Firstly , Europe is in solidarity with them , and we Europeans are doing everything within our means to extricate them from an extremely difficult situation , in a spirit of solidarity and responsibility - and I stress the word responsibility . 
Secondly , the situation that they - and indeed many other countries in Europe - are experiencing is the result of many years of living beyond their means . 
This has to be said , and I call for all Europeans to face up to reality . 
My third message is a product of the first two: Europe can only help Greece , or any other country in difficulty , if it does everything it possibly can to consolidate its economic and financial situation in the long term . 
This will involve making sacrifices , but it will result in positive changes for the country in the end . 
This too must be said , and I cannot help but think of the example of Latvia here: a few years ago , it was on the verge of bankruptcy , and thanks to a courageous recovery policy led by the country ' s twice-elected Prime Minister , Valdis Dombrovskis , it has restored a balanced situation . 
Two different attitudes can be adopted with regard to the current situation: either people settle for marching in the streets and striking - that is part of the trade union movement (I myself was a trade unionist) - or , after having expressed their concern , they set about redressing the situation on the basis of a fair policy . 
My group , ladies and gentlemen , is calling for a shake-up . 
It is calling for all of our countries to wake up to the fact that changes are both necessary and beneficial . 
We will emerge from the crisis not by pinpointing scapegoats (Europe , the International Monetary Fund and others) , but by rolling up our sleeves - and when I say ' us ' , I am of course talking about the political class , but also about all of the 500 million European citizens . 
This brings me back to the European Council , from which we are awaiting confirmation of European solidarity . 
However , beyond the current crisis and in order to achieve a sustainable recovery , we are also awaiting far-reaching economic governance reforms because , while we have completed the monetary side of the economic and monetary union , with the euro , the economic side is inadequate , and we are paying a high price for that today . 
The Group of the European People ' s Party (Christian Democrats) is appealing for the Community method to be used to negotiate the legislative package merely to prevent our Member States from being able to shirk their obligations too easily , as they have done in the past . 
When the Council , with Parliament , decides upon economic regulations to be complied with by the 27 Member States , it is not so that they can be waived at the first opportunity . 
We simply want an assurance that they will be complied with . 
If we can take anything away from the crisis we are going through , it is the need to learn from the past . 
I call on everyone in this Chamber to recognise that . 
I will conclude on a positive note , by welcoming the anticipated Council decision on the forthcoming accession of Croatia , which is set to become the European Union ' s 28th Member State in a few months ' time . This decision will reward the tremendous efforts made by the Croatian people and their government , whose courage and sense of public good I wish to commend . 
This accession is an important and positive signal for Europeans , who are doubting themselves right now . 
However , the values that Europe embodies - solidarity , tolerance , openness towards others , respect for minorities , respect for human rights and human dignity - have never been more deserving of support than in these times of globalisation , when the balance of power too often takes precedence over everything else . 
I am certain that if the people of Europe so wish , and if the Union overcomes division and populism , we will emerge stronger from the difficult times we are currently experiencing . 
I hope that the Heads of State or Government will promote this vision over any other view . 
on behalf of the S&D Group . - (DE) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , rarely has the European Parliament prepared for a European Council meeting during a worse crisis . 
I believe that we should be under no illusions . 
This European Council meeting will be a historic one , because it will decide on the future of this Union . 
I read an interesting line in a German newspaper this week . 
The markets - writes the German newspaper - distrust the European Union because they no longer trust it to find solutions to the problems . 
The people of Europe , the citizens , distrust the European Union because they no longer trust the governments to find solutions to their problems . 
We are in a severe crisis . 
We are in a crisis of confidence in the European project . 
We all have the crisis that we deserve . 
Our problems have been known for a long time . 
The question is whether we intend to address them in a bold or a despondent way , and whether we have courage to do so or whether cowardice will bring us to our knees . 
I will say one thing , which is perhaps one of the most unpopular messages that could be given in Europe right now . 
I will say it nevertheless , because I am firmly convinced that it is right . 
We do not need less Europe , we need more of it ! 
We need more courage to overcome the crisis using European resources . 
(Applause)
Why do we need more Europe ? 
This Council meeting is mainly about two things . 
Firstly , the Heads of State or Government must regain their governance , because it is not the Heads of State or Government alone that decide . 
In this world in which we live there are 43 companies with a balance sheet totalling more than the national budget of a medium-sized EU Member State like Poland . 
That means that there are 43 heads of companies that are at least as powerful as the Polish Prime Minister . 
These people also decide on the fate of the people of this continent . 
Has the fact actually ever been discussed - and this is another issue - that always right on time just prior to an Ecofin meeting , just before a European Council , one , two or three credit rating agencies assess whatever is on the table as a solution to the problems as being inappropriate ? 
Who in actual fact are the people who are wielding the real power over economic development in Europe ? 
Who is behind them ? 
Who is actually paying the credit rating agencies for their ratings ? 
They are clearly not working simply for a reward in heaven . 
Of course , they receive money for their proposals from stakeholders . 
The Heads of State or Government must have the courage to regain the sovereignty of their national , democratic power to act . 
The only way that they can do this is by uniting . 
(Applause)
They will not be able to do this if they split into their constituent parts . 
The EU currently has 7 . 8% of the world ' s population in its 27 Member States . 
Population statistics tell us that in 2050 only 4% of the world ' s population will live here . 
The remaining 96% of the world ' s population will not only take their bearings from Europe . 
The emerging powers and the emerging economies of this world are not waiting for Europe to split into its constituent parts , from large parts like Germany down to very small parts like Malta , in the belief that each individual part will be able to survive on its own - the renationalisation rhetoric that many politicians are giving their people . 
We will only survive in intercontinental competition - environmental , economic , financial and monetary - if we unite . 
If we have the shared will to make the strongest economy in the world - because that is what Europe is if it holds together - into a success by standing together in solidarity . 
Solidarity means sharing . 
Strong shoulders more so than weak shoulders . 
For us , incidentally , that does not mean a financial tax; it means a financial transaction tax . 
If I go to the supermarket and buy a carton of milk , I pay value added tax . 
If I sell a financial product , I pay no tax . 
That is not right . 
Therefore we need this financial transaction tax . 
(Applause)
All of these things have been explained . 
They are on the table . 
Either we will manage to knit Europe together in unity and not play one nation off against the others , or play the feelings of one off against the feelings of the others , or the European integration project is in real danger . 
However , if the European Union fails as a transnational project for securing peace and prosperity and breaks apart , then it will be more than just a political union that breaks apart . 
Then the demons of the 20th century that plunged this continent into misery will quickly reappear . 
The defence of Europe is more than one European summit , it is the defence of a great idea . 
(Applause)
Welcome
I would like to welcome the delegation from Mexico comprising members of Mexico ' s Chamber of Deputies and Senate , who are present in the official gallery . 
Preparations for the European Council meeting (24 June 2011) (continuation of debate)
The next item is the continuation of the debate on the Council and Commission statements on the preparations for the European Council meeting of 23-24 June 2011 . 
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , first of all the key question of this debate today is what we can expect from this European Council on Thursday and on Friday . 
What I hope , and what my group is hoping - as , I think , are the majority in this Parliament - is that we can end this Summit with a more decisive , more comprehensive and bolder approach to the current crisis . 
Let us be honest , we do not have a global comprehensive approach to this current crisis . 
It is not on the table today either in the Council or in Parliament . 
I would say to Martin Schulz that I also have some questions about rating agencies and the role they are playing in the current crisis , but let us try to find errors and the sources of the crisis within our own ranks , and maybe not outside the European Union and outside its institutions . 
Let us be honest about another thing: the crisis is not over . 
Those who think that by giving some additional money to Greece this crisis will come to an end - as regards Greece and the euro - are wrong . 
This crisis is not over , and this crisis will continue if , first of all , we do not find a structural solution for Greece and , secondly , if we do not create a real , economic and political union in Europe . 
Such measures should end the crisis as regards the euro and Greece . 
Again , is it possible to have one currency and 17 governments , 17 economic strategies and 17 bond markets - as we have today and is a situation which does not exist elsewhere in the world ? 
It is only us in Europe who think that we can have one monetary union and 17 different policies , 17 different governments and 17 different bond markets . 
It is not only us - the federalists in the European Parliament - who are saying that . 
Yesterday , Mr Lipsky , the current Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) , said that Europe should create one political and economic union to face this crisis . 
Yesterday it was Mr Geithner , the US Minister of Finance , who was saying ' maybe they can stop and talk with each other; let them create an economic and political union ' . 
If they know on the other side of the Atlantic what we have to do , why do we not have the courage to take this enormous step forward to an economic and political union ? 
That is the key question for the tomorrow ' s Council . 
As regards my second point , we need to help Greece - and not only in a defensive way . 
We need a bold austerity programme , and that is currently what is being discussed with the Greek Government . 
Maybe there are plans to go further than what is on the table now . 
If so , we need a positive plan for it . 
They cannot emerge from the crisis based only on austerity . 
They need to have growth and investment and we can deliver on that within the European Union . 
Let us , for example , give guarantees for private investment . 
Private investment no longer exists in Greece . 
Let us give them loans from the European Investment Bank . 
Why not use part of the privatisation programme not for fiscal consolidation but to create new investment and growth in Greece . 
I now have a request for Mr Daul , and will therefore continue in French . 
(FR) I am going to make my comment in French . 
Mr Daul ' s group comprises members of the Nea Dimokratia party . 
We need to be very clear on that . 
Moreover , if we want all the other countries to give money to Greece , we also need a political consensus to be reached in Greece . 
I believe that we can call on Mr Daul , who was right in what he said , to convince his political friends to reach this political consensus in order to deliver this policy for Greece . 
(Applause)
That is what we need . 
I am well aware that it is an onerous task that we are setting you , Mr Daul , but I know that you are capable of rising to this challenge . 
It is true that a country in such a situation yearns for political unity , and it is not by playing petty political games , as is currently the case in Greece , that this situation will be resolved . 
I experienced this in Belgium for nine years , Mr Lange . 
Mr President , let us be very honest . 
We need a bolder economic governance package than we have on the table today . 
I want to ask President Barroso something directly: yesterday , the spokesman for the European Commission said at the press conference that there was no need for more reverse QMV in the governance package . 
I would ask you , Mr Barroso , to rectify this . 
I would ask that the Commission , together with the European Parliament , employ a more Communitarian method for the economic governance package . 
(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))
(FR) Mr President , I would like to say the following to the Chair of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe: I am sure that when he , with his liberal governments , manages to establish full solidarity for all the various countries , I and my group will have already beaten him to it where Greece is concerned , and I will remind him of that here in this Chamber . 
(FR) Mr President , in most of the countries to which Mr Daul was referring , we are in a coalition with the Christian Democrats , so that certainly must have an impact . 
However , I do not think it appropriate , this afternoon before such an important Council meeting , to play the party political card by pitting one particular government against another . 
I urge you , Mr Daul , not to pit the liberals against the Group of the European People ' s Party (Christian Democrats) or against the socialists . 
What I was asking of you was to convince your friends from the Nea Dimokratia , a party of which , incidentally , many of the members are also our friends and have even , in some cases , moved over to my group , and which has only one aim: to unite the people of Greece so that they can emerge from the crisis they are going through . 
You can play a major role in this . 
I am counting on you . 
(The speaker agreed to take two blue-card questions from Mr Koumoutsakos and Mr Ransdorf under Rule 149(8))
(EL) Mr President , I was delighted to hear Mr Verhofstadt say that everyone now realises that Greece ' s problem is a European problem . 
What does Greece have a duty to do ? 
Greece has a duty to push ahead with major structural reforms and privatisations . 
I should therefore like to advise Mr Verhofstadt , because he has obviously been misled , that on these two issues , which form the cornerstone of the reforms , Nea Dimokratia has not only agreed; it was Nea Dimokratia that made the proposals . 
These are Nea Dimokratia proposals , which the government has been unable to implement for 18 months now . 
That is the truth . 
(CS) Mr President , I listened attentively to Mr Verhofstadt , the Chair of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe , and I would like to ask him whether I am correct in thinking that his motto might be that Greece is everywhere , since Greece is not just a Member State of the European Union , but is actually a state of mind , and that Greece is therefore everywhere . 
Mr President , it is obvious that if we do not resolve the Greek problem we will have huge problems in the whole euro zone . 
We already have problems in Portugal today; we already have problems in Ireland today . 
The difference in spreads today - between Portugal and Germany , between Ireland and Germany - is more than 800 basic points . 
So what we are doing - with the solidarity that we needed from the beginning of this crisis but which was not there - is not only for Greece; it has to be for all Member States of the euro zone . 
It was because of this lack of solidarity that , in December 2009 , we created a far bigger problem - the problem we are facing today . 
on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , it is very entertaining today in the House . 
There are still , let me remind you , a lot of us who experienced Communism and who since then have made enormous and swift progress to prepare ourselves for membership of the European Union . 
We were rightly made to prove ourselves , to prove that we met the Copenhagen criteria , to prove that we enjoyed fully-functioning market economies and so on and so forth , but unfortunately this level of scrutiny was not applied to some European countries when entering the euro zone . 
Why ? 
Simply because it was constructed as a political and not as an economic project , and therefore the criteria were ignored; figures were changed to bring in countries that were not yet ready . 
That is the core of the problem , and now we are living out the consequences and we are at a turning point . 
Believe me , despite the fact that most members of my group are from non-euro zone member countries , we do not want the euro to fail . 
At the same time , it cannot be defended at any cost . 
We are surely on the final pages of the bail-out chapter . 
This European Council should send a clear signal that if a country ' s position is unsustainable within the euro zone then , unless it makes dramatic changes , the euro zone should not hesitate to raise the possibility of restructuring its debt or even - however cruel it might seem - of its leaving the club . 
Mr Barroso , if you do not do that , then I will tell you what will happen next: your opponents - or rather the opponents of your successor - will not be nice , decent Eurosceptics like me , but really nasty anti-Europeans . 
And why ? 
Because they will be elected by angry German taxpayers and by desperate French and Dutch private entrepreneurs fed up of paying other people ' s debts , and I know that neither you nor I want this to happen . 
So let us act accordingly . 
In the same way , I would ask you to please stop using or misusing every crisis as an opportunity to pursue further the supra-nationalistic agenda towards something like fiscal union or tax union , because it leads us nowhere . 
This is not a crisis of Europe . 
This is just a crisis of one wrong , outdated concept of European integration , and that is all . 
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - (DE) Mr President , Mrs Győri , ladies and gentlemen , I am amazed at how raucous the debate on the deepest crisis that the European Union has experienced for a long time has suddenly become . 
When we realise that we are currently defending Schengen , that we have been unable to defend the freedom of the press in Hungary during this Council Presidency , that we needed a long time even to begin to find a common European language with regard to Libya and Egypt , then it is no wonder that , in the face of the worsening situation in Greece , all we can say is that , although we now have many leaders in Europe , we have no leadership . 
I believe that that is one of the major problems that has not been properly addressed . 
In this crisis that has lasted much longer than the Greek crisis , we are also in a situation where all of the solutions that the Council comes up with are coming too late and are too narrow in scope . 
The idea that the European Union can only continue in the way that we want it to and also provide a better life for all Europeans if we rescue Greece and stabilise the South is one that has not been communicated at all up to now , and I believe there is actually an institution responsible for this and that is the European Council . 
I would say that Parliament is not always a shining example , either . 
For example , Parliament refused to come together in good time prior to this historic Council meeting to adopt a resolution to address the problems relating precisely to this historic crisis . 
I found it very regrettable that even those Members on the left who sit here to my right were not able to gather themselves together in good time to make a statement on behalf of Parliament with regard to Greece . 
I would like to take up the subject once again of what is wrong in Greece , because I think that Mr Daul has a responsibility towards Nea Dimokratia . 
However , with regard to justice , the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament also has a responsibility towards Mr Papandreou and his government . 
As pleased as I am that he received a vote of confidence yesterday , the Greek Government will also be involved in deciding on fair programmes in the crisis . 
The fact that this is so unfairly distributed , that the burden is only being borne by the lower sections of society , that no capital levy is being introduced in Greece and that tax evasion is also widespread in Greece is an unfair situation . 
The national solidarity that was mentioned must also result in the elite in Greece , who are after all even today still profiting from the crisis , also taking their share of the responsibility . 
(Applause)
We stick by everything that we have already said on many occasions with regard to Greece . 
Longer timeframes , more favourable loans - we believe that there also needs to be a gentle , systematic and secure rescheduling of debt . 
I believe that it is an expression of the incompetence of the political leadership in the European Union that what we have recognised to be right , namely that private creditors must also share the burden , is not implemented because we are afraid of the credit rating agencies . 
Therefore , the issue that brought us into this crisis is still the dominating factor and so far there has been no political leadership to tackle this . 
I believe that this is the main issue that needs to be discussed during the European Council meeting in the next few days . 
Mr Barroso , I wish you luck with your plan for fairer taxation as a way out of the crisis . 
I do not know whether you are still pursuing the financial transaction tax . 
We are still in favour of it . 
This Parliament has expressed its support for this many times . 
However , I also believe that tax evasion , unfair bonuses and all the factors that helped to cause the financial crash have not as yet been addressed . 
That is also your responsibility . 
Thank you for your attention . 
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - (DE) Mr President , if we look at Greece at the moment , we can also learn something . 
Austerity demands as well as the call to sell off the last of the state-owned silver will not rescue Greece . 
However , everything is just continuing as before . 
Before calling for commitments , yet more austerity measures and privatisations are being demanded . 
At the same time , the attempt is still being made , by means of the European semester , to push this bankruptcy experience as a model for the Member States . 
The whole situation has gone so far that we are considering the establishment of a privatisation agency based on the German Treuhand model . 
Mr Lange , the German Treuhand agency did a number of positive things . 
However , it also brought about massive de-industrialisation and a squandering of state assets . 
The consequences can still be felt today . 
I do not wish to represent this arrogantly as the mistakes of others , however . 
Billions in additional aid for Greece without a clear change of course are nothing more than a safety net for the banks . 
In this regard , we can also do without the voluntary participation of the private sector , so we are told . 
In that case , I would say that this is a political belly flop . 
Things will just carry on as before . 
The only alternative in my view is a radical change in our financial and economic policy . 
However , we lack the courage to do this . 
The causes of the crisis are not being dealt with . 
That is where the problem lies . 
We lack the courage to bring about more democracy and transparency and to conduct less political activity behind closed doors . 
This puts the European idea at risk and allows narrow-minded nationalism to gain ground . 
I would ask that clear signals be sent out from the summit , but the signal must not be ' let us carry on as before ' . 
on behalf of the EFD Group . - Mr President , every time I ask Mr Barroso what his Plan B is , he says there is no need for one . 
Mr Barroso , every time I predict that another country is on the verge of a bail-out you say , ' no no , there is no problem ' . 
Here we are , on the verge of the second Greek bail-out , and you say , ' there is no alternative ' . 
We must continue down this route . 
We must ignore the fact that the Spanish bond market is telling us that they are going to be next . 
What a fine mess you have got us into . 
You have a 100% record for being wrong with every single prediction about the euro and you say today that this package will put Greece on the road to growth , but no it won ' t . 
It will put Greece on the road to a third bail-out , which we will be discussing in a just a few months ' time . 
I have to say I find it a truly sickening sight to see the country that actually invented democracy being bullied by you and the increasingly appalling International Monetary Fund and its people being told they have to accept this austerity package . 
They have to accept cutting their economy to a level that will put them in total economic depression . 
They are told there is no alternative to this; it is a form of sado-monetarism , and it is sending them crazy . 
They are on the streets and there is violence , and frankly this can only get worse . 
You have stripped them not just of money; you have stripped them of their democracy . 
What good Europeans , really good Europeans , would do , is provide an alternative to help the Greeks re-establish their own currency , to allow them to devalue , to let them renegotiate their debts , because their debt-to-GDP ratio has passed the point of no return . 
Then , and only then , can real austerity packages work . 
Only then will the Greek people accept they have got to make these cuts . 
If we carry on down the current road , it is the path to social and economic disaster . 
(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))
(EL) Mr President , I should like to ask Mr Farage if he knows how big the United Kingdom ' s foreign debt is and if he believes that the United Kingdom , as an island , could manage on its own . 
Mr President , the United Kingdom went through this exactly twenty years ago . 
We were part of the exchange rate mechanism . 
We were trapped , trying to peg ourselves against the Deutschmark with interest rates that were double what they should have been . 
It cost 1 million British people their jobs unnecessarily . 
Mercifully we crashed out of exchange rate mechanism , interest rates came down and we had a happy time during the 1990s . 
You cannot fuse together different economies with different rates of growth and with different patterns of trade across the world . 
We learned our lesson . 
We did not join the euro , thank God . 
Those who did are , I am afraid , currently trapped inside an economic prison . 
(NL) Mr President , last Tuesday Mr Barroso said that Greece can count on European support . 
 ' Europe will deliver ' , he said . 
What does Mr Barroso actually base this power upon ? 
Is it not the case that financial aid for Greece is expressly prohibited under the Treaty of Lisbon ? 
Is it not the case that national parliaments have to approve such aid individually ? 
Is it not the case that they are also allowed to say ' no ' ? 
The power of the Commission is expanding further and further . 
It is time we put a stop to that . 
The Commission sees itself as the governor of all European countries , as the ultimate decision-maker under the leadership of Mr Barroso . 
Mr Barroso was not elected democratically . 
No European citizen voted for this man . 
I have but one word for a government that rules without democracy , and that word is ' dictatorship ' . 
A bureaucratic dictatorship that wants to subjugate the Greeks and that also wants to call the shots in the Netherlands . 
It is unacceptable that Mr Barroso should decide whether the Netherlands should grant aid . 
There is only one body that can rule on whether the Netherlands should help Greece and that is the Dutch Parliament . 
Granting aid to Greece is useless . 
It harms the Dutch economy and Dutch citizens . 
On that point , Mr Barroso was actually right . 
After all , on Tuesday , he also said himself that , even if the Greek debt disappeared by magic , the problem would not be resolved . 
The European summit really cannot reach any other conclusion . 
The only long-term solution to this problem is for the Greeks to reintroduce the drachma , which could be devalued on its own . 
That way , the other Member States would not have to pick up the tab . 
President of the Commission . - Mr President , I would just like to answer two concrete questions that were put to me . 
I will not enter into this ideological discussion against Europe in which , may I say , it is interesting to see the extreme right and extreme left united against the euro and against the European project . 
That is why I want once again to appeal to all the democratic forces in Europe , in this Parliament , in Greece , to unite in a consensus to do everything possible to ensure growth and prosperity in Europe . 
The two concrete questions were about the financial tax and about our position on reverse qualified majority . 
On the financial tax , I want to confirm that the proposal that the Commission will put forward , probably in October , will be on a financial transaction tax . 
We have made an impact assessment . 
We believe there are two possibilities: a financial transaction tax and a financial activities tax . 
We have decided to come forward now with a proposal on a financial transaction tax , one reason being precisely that there is no equivalent of VAT for financial transactions . 
So we will come forward with that proposal by October . 
(Applause) . 
The second issue was raised by Mr Verhofstadt . 
I want to make it clear that the Commission supports Parliament on reverse qualified majority voting . 
We have been supporting your ambitious position . 
At the same time - and Olli Rehn will have the opportunity to address you later this afternoon - we will make a strong appeal to you and to the Council to see if it is possible to come to a final agreement . 
Because we also believe that , thanks to Parliament ' s positions , great progress has been achieved in terms of the package that is now up for consideration . 
I want to congratulate you , the Parliament , those that have been working most on this matter , and also the Hungarian Presidency of the Council , as it has done some very important work as well . 
At the end , I want to say to all of you that , in terms of responsibility , the cost of not having an agreement on this matter will be extremely high , considering the current situation . 
The Commission supports the Community approach . 
The Commission supports the greatest possible ambition , which is the line that I think that you are also defining . 
These are the concrete answers to the concrete questions . 
(DE) Mr President , President-in-Office of the Council , Mr Barroso , ladies and gentlemen , a lot has already been said with regard to Greece . 
I would just like to add two thoughts on this matter . 
The first is that , despite all the concern and fear being felt by the people , we must not lose sight of the principles . 
The two principles that define Europe are solidarity - we stand by this - and a sense of individual responsibility - that the Greek people and all those who receive acts of solidarity also take responsibility themselves . 
The second thought is that mention has been made of the big test for Europe and of the concern that the project could perhaps even fail and that old ghosts that we had thought we had eradicated could return to the European Union . 
I would like to turn all of this around and look at it in a positive light . 
We should not just talk about the problems , but also about the successes . 
For example , we should mention that some of the Baltic States have managed to overcome the crisis and that , with European support , Ireland will succeed in returning to the bond markets next year . 
This could also be a big opportunity to prove to the people that we are stronger together than we are alone . 
In this context , it is quite difficult to deal with the second major issue for the Council meeting , namely that of migration . 
However , there is a nice link that connects the two issues , because in relation to the migration issue , in particular Schengen , we also see the same principle at work , namely that one of Europe ' s major successes is now being called into question as a result of national egotism . 
I am sure that we have all seen the figures indicating that 18 000 refugees have arrived in Italy . 
However , we all know that , for Italy , 18 000 refugees is hardly an excessive burden , because twice as many refugees have been received in the last year in Belgium alone . 
It was therefore not right of Italy to react in the way that it did . 
It was internal policymaking by Italy ' s minister of reforms , Umberto Bossi . 
On account of a few hundred people , France responded by reintroducing border controls , and that , too , was for domestic political reasons . 
In Denmark , too , the reasons were of an internal political nature . 
I would therefore like clear signals to be sent out from the Council meeting . 
When the question of migration and Schengen is discussed , the Heads of State or Government of the European Union must respond with the clear message that we do not want national egotism , in particular in this area . 
Instead we want to defend the huge success that is a free Europe . 
Mr Barroso , you will certainly have Parliament ' s support in that . 
(DE) Mr President , President-in-Office of the Council , President of the Commission , I would firstly like to say a few words on a subject that is close to my heart and that , of course , is Croatia . 
I hope that we will succeed in taking a decision to allow Croatia truly to be accepted into the European Union now . 
The Commission has done a good job here - Commissioner Füle , you yourself Mr Barroso and also the Hungarian Presidency in this regard . 
It would be a good and important signal to a problematic region like the Balkans if the country that has completed its task well were to be next in line . 
When I say ' completed its task ' that does not mean that all of the problems are solved . 
We have just experienced some unacceptable situations in Split in connection with the Gay Parade . 
However , it is important for the government to stand up for fundamental freedoms and fundamental rights . 
Allow me to add a few words with regard to Greece . 
Mr Barroso , you said that it will be difficult to explain it to citizens if we do not come up with a solution , for example in connection with the economic governance package . 
However , Mr Barroso , it will also be difficult to explain it to citizens if we only concentrate on austerity . 
You talked about growth and said that we need something to promote growth - but what exactly , Mr Barroso ? 
You cannot believe that austerity alone will lead to growth if we do not at the same time offer alternatives . 
Mr Verhofstadt mentioned a few problems . 
It is not only left-leaning economists - in its economics section yesterday , for example , Le Monde , which is not a left-leaning newspaper , made it quite clear: austerity on the one hand - yes , we need certain restrictions - but we also need growth and investment . 
When there is talk of privatisations , Mr Barroso , you know exactly how to force Greece quickly into a wave of privatisations now - just as Mr Bisky said , things are being sold off . 
However , we must give Greece time to privatise those things that it is sensible to do so at a point in time when it will receive an adequate amount of money for them . 
Secondly , we have to say that we also need to invest some of the money . 
If you say that you want to release regional funds and resources from the Structural Funds then we need to move away from the obligation for cofinancing , because otherwise Greece will not be able to use them . 
These are all proposals that we are waiting for from the Commission , Mr Barroso . 
We are in favour of a frugal policy and of savings where these are necessary , and we are in favour of restrictions and restructuring measures . 
However , it will not work without growth . 
At the end of the day , if we carry on as we are , we will not rescue Greece or our banks , nor will we save our taxpayers; we will instead end up in chaos . 
Therefore , Mr Barroso - and this of course applies to the Council , too - in addition to the structural measures , we also need growth . 
Proposals for growth and employment are crucial for the future of Greece and also for that of Europe . 
(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8) of the Rules of Procedure)
(CS) Mr President , I would like to ask Mr Swoboda whether he agrees with the view that the crisis is being used in certain Member States as a tool for relieving citizens of their assets by stealth . 
Does he also see it in this way ? 
(DE) Mr President , in all of the countries that are experiencing a crisis , there have been genuine problems . 
There is absolutely no point in denying that . 
This situation can be abused from two different sides . 
It can be abused , as some credit rating agencies are doing , for example , by giving advice that drives countries to ruin . 
However , it can also be abused by making political statements to the effect that we do not need to change anything . 
If some of the demonstrators , in Greece for example or in other countries , believe that we do not need to change anything and that we can carry on as before , then they are wrong . 
We are therefore in favour of giving our full support to the measures proposed by Mr Papandreou ' s government . 
These measures are a step in the right direction . 
They must be supported , and that is something that some of the trade unionists in Greece also need to recognise - the only way to overcome this is if , at the same time , we pursue a policy of growth together . 
I wanted to make that absolutely clear . 
In other words , no abuse from either side . 
That is extremely important . 
(DE) Mr President , following the confidence vote yesterday in Athens with the result that we are all aware of , the Bild newspaper in Germany printed the headline ' Greek leader has survived - Europe can breathe a sigh of relief ' . 
I have to say that I was also pleased with the result of this vote , but I think it is far too early to breathe a sigh of relief . 
This is because we now need to put the substantial austerity package successfully in place in the next week . 
That is the next big test . 
Even then , we will be a long way from being able to breathe a sigh of relief . 
Further steps and measures will still need to be taken before this crisis is overcome . 
I believe that what has been said here is right . 
The people in Greece need a light at the end of the tunnel . 
However , I would also like to make it quite clear that the people in the countries from which most of the aid is coming also need a light at the end of the tunnel . 
They have the feeling that they are giving and giving and giving and there is no end to it . 
In Greece the people have the feeling that they are saving and saving and saving and there is no end to it . 
That is why a growth strategy is so important . 
That is why privatisations are crucial to break open and liberalise this encrusted economy . 
That is why it is right for us resolutely to promote and support the reduction of public debt in Greece . 
Democracy has to endorse this . 
What is happening with respect to Mr Samaras is totally irresponsible . 
However , it is right for us to give guarantees for investments , for example . 
It is also right for us to draw out unused EU funds , Mr Barroso , and make them available to Greece , because ultimately it will not only be Greece but the whole of Europe that will benefit from more growth . 
If we look ahead slightly , one thing is also important: the Stability and Growth Pact must be strengthened . 
We must prevent future crises . 
This is where this reverse qualified majority comes in . 
No ordinary citizen will understand what that actually means . 
To put it plainly , either the Stability and Growth Pact has this strange technical element that I have just mentioned , and then the Stability and Growth Pact will have teeth , or else it does not . 
Then we will not be able to support this package . 
Reverse qualified majority voting in the preventive phase of the Stability and Growth Pact is absolutely essential as far as we are concerned . 
Mr Barroso , I am extremely pleased to hear you explain once again that the Commission is of exactly the same opinion . 
I would like to see substantial support for this project from this House . 
(DE) Mr President , thank you Mr Lambsdorff , I am of the opinion that Greece urgently needs political unity . 
However , that of course starts with the fact that the proposals put forward there must ultimately be fair . 
There will only be unity in the country if there is renewed trust in the political and economic elite there . 
For that to be possible , the proposals made need to bring about unity . 
However , the question that I would like to ask you is this: I would also like to see some consistency in your group . 
Here you are calling for Eurobonds , but in Germany you have declared Eurobonds to be a kind of blasphemy . 
It is from your group in the German parliament that we see the greatest opposition to common European . . . 
(The President cut off the speaker)
Mr Giegold , you cannot use the blue-card procedure if you are not going to ask a question . 
Therefore , Mr Graf Lambsdorff surely has nothing to answer . 
(EL) Mr President , as a Greek , I should like to thank the European Commission , the Council and the European Parliament for all the support they have given Greece to date . 
In particular , I should like to thank everyone in the Commission who has been working so hard for 18 months now to resolve the Greek crisis . 
We have talked about Europe a great deal in the European Parliament today . 
I should just like to make one patriotic comment in this multinational Chamber . 
We Greeks gave Europe its name and we made a decisive contribution to what we refer to as ' European civilisation ' and ' European values ' . 
What are we Greek politicians and the Greek people asking for ? 
We are asking for your respect and your solidarity . 
What can we promise ? 
That we shall work very hard to put the country which we brought to this point - this is , first and foremost , our problem and we are to blame - back on its feet . 
Allow me to make three proposals: . . . . . 
(The President cut off the speaker)
Mr President , the presence of large numbers of alleged asylum seekers from Libya and Tunisia will be on the agenda . 
Tunisia is a country that has toppled its dictator , so what are these Tunisians fleeing from ? 
Democracy ? 
Perhaps we should expect to see Mr Ben Ali , a recently retired dictator , at the head of the queue . 
Libya is a war zone . 
But people do not become asylum seekers simply because they live in a dangerous country . 
There must be something about that particular person that places that person in jeopardy . 
The argument seems to be about whether Italy or Malta should accept them for settlement because they are the first country they reached , or whether they should be accepted for settlement by other Member States . 
My answer is that neither should accept them for settlement and they should sooner or later be returned to North Africa . 
If EU asylum rules really say that a mere claim to be an asylum seeker is enough to create an obligation to accept them , then the rules must be changed . 
Rules are man-made and can be unmade . 
If that means Member States , and indeed the EU itself , repudiating other international agreements , then so be it . 
Member States have been changed beyond recognition by migration . 
The time has come to stop the flow and encourage its reversal . 
The accession of Croatia is also on the agenda . 
What steps will the EU take to ensure the referendum will be held fairly , with both sides being heard and equal amounts of money being spent ? 
I suspect that a free and fair referendum in not on the cards . 
The country will be deluged with EU propaganda and those arguing against Croatia ' s accession will be phased out of the debate . 
(HU) Mr President , the next European Council meeting will also be about trust . 
We have reached a historic moment . 
It is historic , because we will identify the challenges that the European Union has to face , and to which we now have to give nothing but responsible answers . 
These answers , however , are closely interconnected . 
First , however , I would like to congratulate the Hungarian Presidency on its great work and express my thanks for it . 
In particular , I would like to thank Minister of State Enikő Győri , who was always present everywhere , for her work . 
She set a strict timetable that the Presidency as a whole managed to keep , while maintaining a Parliament-friendly attitude , for which I thank them again . 
This half-year has been a real challenge , because it was not only a new task for the Hungarian Presidency , but the tasks themselves were new as well . 
Just think about the initiation and institutionalisation of the European semester , and the ' six-pack ' of economic governance , created within the framework of the co-decision procedure , that will bring a fundamentally new economic approach . 
There are great expectations towards the approaching Council meeting , and towards issues of the package that have yet to be resolved through compromise . 
At the same time , the Council and Parliament bear a huge responsibility over the agreement , because they have to decide whether they want to follow the bad practices that have lead to the weakening of the Stability and Growth Pact and indirectly to the crisis as well , or put an end to the policy of agreements made at Member State level and bad bargains , and finally give space to a new economic policy approach that will offer common European solutions , is built on commonly established rules , and will finally complete the economic policy aspect of integration , with a strong Europe in focus . 
Citizens , national parliaments and the markets all expect the European Union to shape the European economy uniformly , following commonly accepted rules , to ensure the stability of the common currency and to protect European citizens from the crisis efficiently . 
(ES) Mr President , the Members of the European Parliament fully understand that the debate on the European Council which is set to be held on 23 and 24 June will continue to focus on the persistent crisis and the problems faced by the euro , and Greece . 
However , I should like to join those who have pointed out that the agenda does not end there . 
We also have a duty to discuss the question marks raised over elements that are central to the area of freedom , justice and security , specifically Schengen , which is probably the key asset for the free movement of persons . 
We cannot allow the cry for democracy that has spread across North Africa to be met with anything other than a clear , categorical response . 
Moreover , this response cannot be a reform of the Schengen Treaty . 
On the contrary , it should be a strengthening of the Schengen Treaty . 
There are precedents clearly indicating that , faced with unexpected , abrupt migratory pressures , as was the case in the Canary Islands , in Spain , between 2004 and 2006 , the response given cannot just be more , better Europe , but also a supportive contribution to the demand for better democracy in the neighbouring countries . 
We know that Malta , Italy and France have been subjected to this pressure , but we have to be very clear that the Council must do its part by completing the asylum package , completing the immigration package , completing the reform of the Frontex Regulation and , not least , by updating the solidarity clause included in Article 80 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union , which means updating Directive 2001 / 55 / EC . 
Lastly , I should also like to express my concern about the message that has been sent out , aimed at instituting a response mechanism that will enable re-establishment of the Union ' s internal borders in certain extraordinary circumstances . 
We must be extremely clear about what we are dealing with and what the European dimension will be , strictly in relation to the EU institutions , so that we will not find ourselves on a slippery , or indeed counterproductive , slope . 
Mr President , after an era of openness , tolerance and enthusiasm for Europe , we have seen in recent years a deterioration of our unity and a division among Europeans , even in this House , on issues such as freedom of movement , immigration , national interest and , above all , money . 
Unfortunately , this global economic crisis highlights the worst of our nationalist and populist views . 
The chaos of daily declarations on Greece by national politicians and stakeholders is only adding to the confusion and creating more speculation on the markets . 
The risk of contamination of every single Member State is a real one . 
While Greece shares its burden of responsibility in its crisis , our European leaders share theirs as well . 
If a year ago the EU had shown a unified and total commitment to helping Greece , we would not now be jumping from one rescue plan to another . 
We do not need more technical solutions . 
What we need is cohesion , determination and unity , because what we are playing is a psychological war and what the market is testing is Europe ' s unity , not the Greek austerity plan . 
It is crucial to send an unequivocal message of support and encouragement that Europe is standing behind Greece . 
In addition , we should lower the interest rate and show more flexibility in accessing EU funds . 
Besides , Greece must also be ready to take its fate in its hands . 
While reforms and austerity measures are necessary , we should also remember that this is not enough in the long term to recover . 
We must go back to the basics , encourage investment and promote growth . 
I hope that tomorrow no European leader will default on solidarity , because Greece is just a page in the book which is Europe; so if we stand by Greece , we stand by Europe . 
(IT) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , on the subject of Greece I will say that one only needs to listen to what has been discussed to realise what stage European governance is at . 
In fact it is steering by sight , with no precise aims . 
We have not been told anything for which I would keep my fingers crossed if I were a Greek citizen - perhaps a Greek worker or a small Greek entrepreneur facing ruin . 
As regards immigration , I have heard Italy criticised for not wanting to accept any refugees . 
A few hours ago , however , Mrs Malmström issued a public statement saying that when the tragedy of the Libyan exodus began everyone undertook to receive at least 800 refugees per country . 
In practice , nobody is receiving them , and she highlighted the positive case of Norway . 
They land in Lampedusa and a few in Malta , and we are the only ones taking them in . 
Italy has received them . 
Italy . 
People were talking about Minister Bossi , and there is also the Home Affairs Minister , Mr Maroni: both ministers are from this racist Lega Nord party , which has received the refugees . 
Unless there is proof to the contrary , that is the truth . 
Lastly there is the Croatia chapter . 
It is very important for Croatia to join , but it is also important to remember that the Pope warned the Croats to beware of a bureaucratic , centralist structure . 
(IT) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it is precisely the complexity and , if you like , the toughness of the agenda for the Council of 24 June that bring us up against the shortcomings of the instruments available to us . 
What exactly is available to us ? 
The European Union is . 
The European Union is a work in progress , an unfinished work , which we have so often failed to complete precisely because of our weakness and fear . 
The European Union is available to us , but the United States of Europe is not . 
That means that , when national governments are wavering due to internal issues , we do not have an instrument that we can activate in order to implement what might be a solution to our problems . 
To succeed in finally making the United States of Europe available to us will require leadership not only from the national governments but primarily from the European institutions . 
I believe - President Barroso is not here any more - that his prudence won him his second election . 
I would very much like to vote for him for a third time , but this time for his courage . 
In other words , as he has been re-elected once for his prudence , I would like to re-elect him for a third term for his courage . 
Therefore , given the tough agenda to be tackled by the Council on 24 June , I expect the leadership shown by the Commission and the European institutions to persuade the national governments to put our ideals before whatever is in our interests . 
I think that is the only feasible way forward . 
Otherwise , we will continue to hold debates in which we grumble about the fact that perhaps the French Government has taken an initiative about Schengen for internal reasons , or the Italian Government has refused to admit someone or other , or the Greek Government is still too weak to really be able to take responsibility for its own decisions . 
The main issue , however , lies elsewhere: unless the political nature of the European project is clarified , we will be incapable of dealing with our problems . 
(EL) Mr President , may I start by adding my thanks to those expressed by Mrs Tzavela - and I wish to thank her for that - to the parliaments and people of Europe for the support which they have given and are continuing to give to my country . 
As developments over the last few days have illustrated , Greece is determined to continue with and make a success of its efforts to restructure its finances and promote structural reform . 
However , if these efforts are to be crowned with success , two conditions need to be satisfied . 
The first condition is that we must be able to give the people not just austerity , but also positive prospects , prospects of growth , prospects of employment and prospects of new jobs . 
The second condition is that we need an environment of security and support from the European Union , an environment of political cohesion because , throughout the crisis and , in particular , over the last few weeks , we have seen an informal public dialogue between European capitals , the European Commission and the European Central Bank , with the credit rating agencies acting as a strange sort of referee , in connection with the much talked about involvement of the private sector in the new Greek bail-out . 
This strange sort of refereeing does not do credit either to the European Union or to political union . 
We need to silence this cacophony , because it is only in an environment of political cohesion that we can hope for the right conditions that will allow the tremendous efforts being made by the Greek people to be crowned with success . 
Mr President , the big question facing EU leaders tomorrow is whether they are up to the task of saving European achievements in the common currency and free-movement zone . 
 ' More Europe ' is not the answer to everything , but on key issues like these we do need strengthened ability for European decision-making . 
I welcome President Barroso ' s much tougher statement today than in our debate on Schengen and migration in May . 
He should then have read the riot act to Italy and France in the way that Manfred Weber of the PPE did earlier in this debate . 
In an excellent article published in the Financial Times yesterday , Mario Monti deplored both the excessive deference to big Member States and the ' culture of politeness ' in the Council , which meant that Member States refused to call each other to account for failings . 
I would rather more crudely call it: ' I will scratch your back if you scratch mine ' . 
This was disastrous over the issue of Greece ' s fraudulent statistics . 
We need EU-level powers of decision and action on major issues , but we also need the honesty without which mutual trust is impossible . 
(IT) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we have seen that no country can face the problem of immigration alone . 
It is essential to have a policy governing large migration movements that supports development cooperation and provides for multilateral and bilateral agreements with the migrants ' countries of origin and of transit . 
Unfortunately , the new European external action instruments have not been used in the spirit or with the vision of the Treaties , as Italy is now finding . 
The front-line Member States have in fact had to face the refugee crisis by means of unilateral initiatives , without being able to rely on European solidarity . 
I therefore call on the Commission to define the cases in which we can talk of a ' mass influx of displaced persons ' under the terms of Directive 2001 / 55 / EC on temporary protection , thereby setting precise , measurable criteria that can be regarded as permanent . 
Such clarification is important for promoting an effective common policy on migration and ensuring that the burden is shared . 
(FR) Mr President , I too would like to offer my warm congratulations to Minister Győri , President-in-Office of the Council , on her Presidency . 
I would also like to welcome the Vice-President of the European Commission and make two remarks . 
The first concerns Greece . 
I think there is a need to consolidate the financial situation and to devise measures to promote growth . 
With regard to financial consolidation , it is clear that dealing with the past while planning for the future is extremely difficult . 
I propose the creation of a kind of credit mediator , which could house Greece ' s bad debt in a suitable financial , or hive-off , structure . 
Since the political consensus we have reached is not to allow capital losses , why not split the Greek debt up and thus allow the Greek Government to manage the future and this mediator basically to sort out the past through restructuring ? 
As regards interest rates , a contribution is required from the banks , which made huge profits by purchasing debts at 16% and then doubled their capital when they dropped to 8% . 
I also propose an investigation into financial transactions involving sovereign debt , which the European Securities and Markets Authority could be entrusted with carrying out . 
Credit institutions have to a certain extent provided what we call , in French law , a form of unfair assistance to an over-indebted structure . 
They are therefore guilty of misconduct and have caused harm: they need to make amends for that . 
On the subject of growth , we must support President Barroso ' s proposed EUR 1 billion plan , and we must deliver a proper development plan for Greece . 
I approve of the idea put forward by Mr Cohn-Bendit: why not focus on military expenditure , which accounts for 4% of GDP ? 
Furthermore , if the European Union could arbitrate between Turkey and Cyprus , I believe we would save Greece 2% of its GDP . 
Those are the kinds of measures which would help bring about a development plan for Greece . 
(PT) Mr President , my expectations for the forthcoming Council are rather low , because division reigns in the European Union: instead of decision there is hesitation , and instead of solidarity there is selfishness . 
That is how Europe is going . 
Let us look at the case of Greece . 
I am not going to talk about my own country , Portugal , because the new government has only just come to power . 
All I can do , therefore , is to wish it every success for the sakes both of the Portuguese and of Europe . 
Let us talk about Greece , then . 
Greece is not just any country . 
It has been a full Member of the European Union for decades , and it belongs to the Euro Group . 
It is important to remember that Greece was the cradle of democracy . 
These facts should be enough for Greece to be treated with greater respect by the European Union . 
The Greeks are responsible for the terrible situation that they are in , but so are the European institutions . 
Mr Papandreou , the Prime Minister , has done everything in his power to get out of this difficult situation . 
With enormous courage and dignity he has adopted the austerity measures , whether they are feasible or unfeasible . 
What is happening to Greece may one day apply to Ireland or Portugal , to Spain or Belgium , or to Italy or France . 
I have a question for the European institutions: how can countries in difficulties bear the scandalous interest rates imposed on them and at the same time reduce their budget deficit and public debt and promote economic growth and create jobs ? 
Do you not think that with that kind of treatment these countries run the risk of dying not from the disease but from the cure ? 
That is not the right path . 
What is needed is a concerted plan to defend the single currency , to fight off speculation on sovereign debts and to denounce the rating agencies , which are primarily to blame for the crisis we are undergoing . 
(FR) Mr President , the first precaution to be taken if we want to prevent a large-scale blaze is to stop playing with fire . 
I agree with President Barroso when he states that the Greek Government must do everything it can to put its house in order so that the European Union can , in turn , take action . 
In other words , Greece must regain its credibility . 
Does the same call for responsible behaviour not deserve to be addressed to all the governments in the EU ? 
Are all the political leaders aware of the impact of the statements they have made about Greece over the last 18 months ? 
The time has come for the European Council to put a stop , tomorrow , to the discord among its members . 
Four things are needed in order to prevent the Greek crisis from having a much-feared domino effect across the entire euro area: firstly , a united Greece with an economic and budgetary recovery plan; secondly , a European Union and a Euro Group which are united by the same objective; thirdly , a little more time than initially planned , particularly for privatisations; and fourthly , solidarity which is properly understood and which comprises not only new loans , but also , and above all , technical assistance from its partners , and in particular from the Commission . 
(PT) Mr President , first of all I must say that I am expecting some highly responsible decision making from this European Council , particularly in view of the economic climate we have been experiencing in recent weeks . 
It must be more responsible than the last Council , which tried to put a problem off for three months merely because of electoral timetables . 
What I expect from this responsible decision making is essentially for people to realise that economic and financial issues are crucial and decisive for Europe , but that they are instrumental for Europe ' s primary purpose , which is to keep the peace . 
If we take an approach to problems that only leads to the Member States beginning to mistrust each other , to sowing mistrust between the various states , to creating and exacerbating differences and rivalries between southern and northern states and between central and peripheral states , the end result will be the decline of the European Union . 
I believe that what is at stake in this European Council , regardless of the technical solutions or political disagreements , is knowing whether or not we want the European project to continue to be a valid blueprint for a strategy for peace in Europe . 
I believe that is what is at stake . 
What I notice in the speeches of many leaders , whether they are in countries in difficulties or countries that pay out and are net contributors , is an irresponsible discourse that often even appeals to certain extremely negative features of their nationalities . 
For that reason , and that reason alone , I appeal to the sense of responsibility of European government leaders to come up with solutions that enable Europe to find a way out and to resolve the situation . 
(IT) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , mutual fear and mistrust - as Mr Mauro was saying just now - are guiding the decisions made by European governments on the crisis . 
Europe looks to me like a football team that is losing 2-0 whose players think they can recover by not passing the ball any more and trying to score alone . 
No match can be won by playing alone , however . 
Not even Maradona or Pelé could win the match of this crisis by themselves . 
The Greek crisis could have been controlled in its early stages . 
Instead , we pressed on and have now reached a very tricky point , which must be tackled by leaving damaging jealousies and failed economic recipes behind once and for all . 
We should tell the truth and admit that many of today ' s heads of government are proving to be second-rate leaders . 
They cannot understand that the crisis was certainly not caused by Greece or even by the sovereign debt situation , but by the financial markets , which until the other day were unregulated . 
Now the governments are again offering us the usual poisoned bait: let us sort out our public accounts and then we will see who is left alive . 
Nobody will be left alive , however , and above all the vital part of European society will not be left alive . Instead , we need to aim for growth by aiming and focusing resources on research , training and the major challenges , and starting a virtuous circle . 
Lastly , we should speak plainly about immigration . 
Schengen should not be touched; at most it can be strengthened , but it should not be touched because it is an inalienable achievement that keeps the European Union standing . 
Migrant flows must be governed from Brussels in a way that rewards inclusion , solidarity and security . 
(RO) Mr President , the Council will bring the Hungarian Presidency to an end . 
The efforts of this Presidency should be commended for completing important dossiers , including some extremely controversial ones . 
This is a very important meeting because it will be seen whether the European semester is going to be implemented . 
The recommendations must be applied by Member States to prevent stability being jeopardised . 
Now is the time when Member States need to prove their responsible commitment to abiding by the new mechanism . 
Stability or convergence programmes and domestic reform programmes are needed , but are not enough . 
Agreement must be reached on the meaning of economic governance . 
Parliament has achieved a compromise with great effort , which I hope will be supported by the vote tomorrow . 
It is the Council ' s turn to adopt this package of paramount importance to the Union . 
The Schengen area has been a major talking point recently . 
The evaluation mechanism obviously needs to be revamped . 
Reintroducing borders unilaterally is not a solution . 
If a Member State is unable to meet its external border responsibilities , support measures and the involvement of Frontex are required . 
If the situation is not resolved , the Council , at the Commission ' s suggestion , can decide by qualified majority to reintroduce border controls for a limited period . 
I believe that introducing borders unilaterally , as is happening at the moment , is not a solution . 
Approval of the Presidency ' s report on the means for promoting Roma inclusion in the European Union and of the conclusions concerning the launch of the EU Strategy for the Danube Region may mark important steps in the implementation of these vital policies for the European Union . 
Mr President , the weakness of the Stability Pact has been one factor in this deepening economic crisis , which has grown into a credibility crisis . 
Nobody is blameless in this respect . 
We have now reached an emergency situation where solidarity and responsibility are all that count , but solidarity does not just mean all for one . 
In exactly the same way it means one for all . 
Every Member State has to take responsibility for the ownership of our Union and start acting for the common good of Europe . 
We do need more Europe , and more Europe means more discipline , including concrete measures against those who continue to violate the rules . 
To restore the euro zone ' s credibility , the Commission ' s role has to be to become both stronger and more independent in exercising economic governance and conducting surveillance . 
The Commission needs a mandate to assess the economic situation in the Member States , so it can issue recommendations and warnings in time . 
But the crucial issue will be the political will and ability to apply fines . 
Their application should become a rule , not an object of political bargaining . 
The role of the Council should be duly limited , in procedures that lead to potential sanctions . 
The EU ' s credibility can be restored by improving the quality of statistics , excluding in the future any manipulation and falsifying of fiscal data . 
My country , Estonia , faced a deep economic crisis three years ago . 
However , we acted , balanced the budget and entered the euro zone . 
Latvia acted too and is clearly back on track . 
All for one and one for all . 
We all have to act in reforming our societies . 
Cutting expenses hurts , but remains the only way back to growth and stability . 
Mr President , we have heard a lot today about giving and giving and giving and cutting and cutting and cutting . 
I want to add another dimension to the mix , and that is ' taking and taking and taking ' . 
I am referring in particular to the interest rate being charged by the ECB to my own country , Ireland . 
We are struggling manfully to reach our targets in relation to the bail-out . 
But this is not helping us . 
Thankfully , the EP and the Commission see that we are being unjustly and unfairly treated . 
Charging an interest rate like the one we are being charged is akin to tying a millstone around the neck of a drowning man while you are sending out the lifeboat to save him . 
I would ask , particularly tomorrow , for the Council to reduce the interest rate on Ireland . 
If it does so , we will return to growth , we will meet our commitments and we will be a great nation , part of Europe once again . 
(HU) Mr President , the European Council will hopefully endorse the three successful objectives of the Hungarian Presidency: the Danube strategy , the Roma strategy and the conclusion of accession negotiations with Croatia . 
The key objective , however , would be the adoption of the ' six-pack , ' the legislative package on economic governance . 
Hungarian experts and diplomats deserve the highest praise for their great work , because they managed to reduce the number of issues between the Council and the European Parliament to only a few . 
In order to break the deadlock of the negotiations , the Hungarian Government needs to achieve compromises at the highest possible level . 
Whether the government of Viktor Orbán has enough political capital to do so , however , is still in question . 
Is Mr Matolcsy , who had openly and harshly attacked the European semester before , able to argue credibly in favour of strengthening economic governance ? 
I hope that we can still reach a breakthrough in the Council . 
Europe needs the introduction of economic governance as soon as possible . 
(PT) Mr President , what the serious economic and social situation affecting several Member States of the Union deserves from this forthcoming June European Council is very careful consideration , deep reflection on its causes , and acceptance of responsibility for the increasingly neoliberal Union policies , such as privatisations and the devaluing of labour , which are causing more social inequality , greater economic divergence , and more unemployment , poverty and social exclusion . 
The Council members are indifferent to the struggle of workers and ordinary people and , unfortunately , what they are proposing is to make permanent the neoliberal policies that have already led to serious crises in Greece and Ireland and are threatening Portugal and other Member States . 
In the end , what they are trying to do is to make it easier to gain more profit from capital and from greater financial speculation , and always at the expense of the same groups as ever: workers , micro- , small and medium-sized enterprises , farmers and people affected by these investment cuts and austerity policies . 
(DE) Mr President , the EU ' s current migration policy has failed . 
An example of this is the Commission ' s plans for so-called mobility partnerships in order to give the mass influx of people from North Africa a semblance of legality . 
Mrs Malmström has declared many times that Europe is allegedly dependent on immigration from North Africa . 
However , the fact that many Member States are having to deal with high levels of unemployment , particularly among young people , is deliberately ignored . 
In Libya , the population has doubled in the last 20 years . 
Thus , if the gates to North Africa were opened , the pressure on the European labour market would increase further . 
Therefore , we do not need more immigration from North Africa , but rather a stop to immigration altogether . 
Our citizens do not want mobility partnerships in this regard; instead they want readmission partnerships . 
Our fellow citizens do not want open borders , but rather the reintroduction of controls and a strengthening of Frontex . 
This also ought to be considered at the forthcoming Council meeting when ' progress ' in immigration policy is discussed . 
(PL) Mr President , we have spent most of our time discussing the crisis in Greece , and quite rightly so , for it is an enormous problem . 
Yet during yesterday ' s debate , Mr Barroso also asked us for our support on the Schengen issue . 
The fact that Mr Barroso has asked us in Parliament for our support means that he must be anticipating a very difficult situation , and difficult talks with the heads of the various governments . 
I would like to say that the Schengen area , and the freedom it brings to travel around Europe , was a symbol of freedom and of the European Union , and one of the chief assets and greatest merits of the European Union , for me personally , as a Pole , and for all Polish people . 
We cannot allow this freedom to be limited , or for the Schengen area to disintegrate , for it is precisely decisions and policies of this kind that determine how the EU is perceived . 
Therefore I would call not only for the Schengen system to be defended , but also for Romania and Bulgaria to be included , or rather involved in this system as soon as possible . 
(PL) Mr President , it has given me great satisfaction during today ' s debate to see the two camps which have emerged in respect of the reasons behind this state of affairs and the recommendations; the neo-liberals on one side , and the left-wing Members on the other . 
It is apparent that after so many months of debates on the situation in Europe , we have come to the conclusion firstly that there is a very high level of threat , and secondly that cooperation is necessary . 
In connection with this , I was happy to hear Mr Barroso say today that a proposal will be submitted regarding a tax on financial transactions . 
I am pleased that this is the case . 
It is a shame that we are not already working with a final draft , but the fact that a draft exists is very much to be welcomed . 
If I may , I should like to emphasise one more matter: for the time being we are focusing on the euro area , but we also have a ' non-euro area ' in the European Union , and we should ensure that this does not experience problems either . 
(MT) Mr President , on the immigration issue , we expect three things tomorrow . 
Firstly , that the Schengen Area is defended because it represents freedom for our citizens and constitutes one of the most visible elements for European Union citizens . 
Secondly , we expect shared responsibility on the external borders too , not just on the internal ones . 
This will require a stronger Frontex Agency , as well as increased solidarity and the parcelling out of responsibilities in a fair and just manner . 
It will also necessitate greater cooperation with the Southern Mediterranean countries that have undergone revolutions . 
Above all , what we need most of all tomorrow is true political will . 
If this is lacking then we will never practise what we preach . 
Vice-President of the Commission . - Mr President , today ' s lively and animated debate is clear proof that the agenda of the European Council is highly relevant and critically important for the future of Europe . 
Greece was very much present in most of our interventions . 
We know that the situation in Greece is very difficult and that there are no easy solutions . 
I agree with all of you who said that it is very important to demonstrate to the Greek people that it is not only about cuts and austerity , but that there is also light at the end of the tunnel and that we can actually help Greece to get back onto the path of growth . 
Austerity must therefore be accompanied by pro-growth policies and measures . 
I am absolutely sure that the European Union and the Commission can do that . 
We can help Greece to increase administrative capacity . 
We can help Greece to absorb structural funds better and put them in strategic pro-growth sectors , and we can help the Greek authorities to improve the quality of their tax collection . 
We know how to help countries improve their educational systems . 
I think we can all do it now , and the Commission is ready to proceed in that way . 
We are prepared to put together technical assistance programmes which will accompany the difficult austerity measures the Greek authorities have to go through . 
By this , we would like to show clearly that Europe cares; Europe is solidarity and Europe can help if the country is in such distress . 
However , the same message needs to come from the Greek political establishment . 
We can do our best , but what we need from the Greek authorities is a clear show of unity , and a clear show of resolve to tackle the difficult issues in that country . 
This would be my appeal and the appeal of the Commission to the Greek political representatives: cooperate , show us unity , show us a united approach to the very difficult issues . 
The time is right and this would be a highly responsible gesture . 
Not many of you touched upon the very important element of the conclusion of the European semester . 
However , I will mention it here because we need the help of the members of the European Parliament to go back to their constituencies and explain that the European semester is over and national semesters are starting . 
I think we know what to do; we have country-specific recommendations which are very fair , very honest and very detailed for each Member State , but now we need the cooperation of the national authorities and of the national governments to actually deliver and to carry out the reforms in the Member States . 
Only by this will we change the quality and competitiveness of the European economy for the better and put the European economy on new wheels . 
I would like to confirm once again that a financial transaction tax will be proposed by the European Commission . 
We needed to carry out a very thorough impact assessment and that is about to be concluded . 
This will be one of our proposals , and one of our inputs into the global debate on these very important issues . 
Again , Europe will provide leadership on this issue and we hope that our global partners will follow . 
Several of you referred to the Schengen area and to the importance of having high quality immigration policies in place . 
I would like to assure you that we are absolutely aware of the fact that freedom and the rights of persons to free movement within Europe is one of the most important achievements , and we should treasure it . 
The Commission will act as the guardian of the treaties and would be ready to act if the basic foundations of these projects are called into question . 
After recent developments , we also have to acknowledge that we need a complex solution for all aspects of migration and that we need to consolidate trust in the system . 
Therefore , the Commission is convinced that only a coordinated and Community-based process is adequate as opposed to unilateral initiatives by Member States to re-introduce internal border controls . 
We also need a common European Asylum System that is more efficient and more protective . 
We will do our utmost to ensure that the system is up and running by 2012 . 
This is the Commission ' s approach and I hope that it will be supported by the European Parliament and by the Member States . 
Please allow me a few short words on economic governance and the ' six pack ' . 
You have already heard the position of the Commission President and you will have a chance to discuss this issue in greater detail with my fellow Commissioner , Olli Rehn . 
I would underline only one element and that is the importance of having an agreement sooner rather than later , because time is pressing and we need our new tools in order to govern European economies in better and more reliable ways in the future . 
A concluding remark on Croatia . 
I think that it is time and it is appropriate to congratulate Croatia , because it is approaching a historical moment and I believe that this should give a very positive signal , not only for all Croatians , but for all the peoples of the western Balkans . 
I would also like to congratulate the European Parliament and its rapporteur , Mr Swoboda , and also the Hungarian Presidency , which did an excellent job of pushing this so far forward , enabling us to have these very good results at this time . 
The last word of thanks goes to Ms Enikő Győri . 
She said many times that she wanted to lead a parliament-friendly Presidency . 
I think she has proved it with her frequent presence in this House . 
I would also like to thank her for her excellent cooperation with the Commission . 
President-in-Office of the Council . - (HU) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , let me use my mother tongue this last time that I participate in the plenary session . 
First of all , I would like to thank you all for recognising our work , as we could hear many MEPs from various groups conclude that the Hungarian Presidency did a good job . 
I personally believe that it is indeed worth leading a Parliament-friendly Presidency in the European Union . 
President Barroso alluded to the ' six-pack , ' and Vice-President Šefčovič mentioned the negotiations with Croatia and the different dossiers . 
The existence of the co-decision procedure in the European Union gives the Council and the Presidency the opportunity to build personal relations with a large number of Members , and to raise mutual awareness within the institutions of each other ' s problems , which I believe is a great opportunity for us all . 
Thank you for organising this debate today . 
I believe that we agree on the fundamental principles and basic values , of which much has been said today , and even European integration philosophies have been discussed , and I have to say that most of the Members ' speeches reflected this agreement between us . 
We also agree that the European Council has to tackle extremely difficult issues today . 
I would be more careful when using the word ' historical ' , because I think we depreciate the concept if we use it too often . 
I strongly agree that fear and mistrust are bad counsellors , and EU leaders should not be led by these emotions during the meetings tomorrow and the day after tomorrow . 
It is my credo , and that of the Hungarian Presidency as well , that we have to base all our steps on trust - and I would even say mutual trust - , on taking responsibility and on solidarity , just like you have urged us . 
Whether it be about economic policy , Schengen reforms , asylum or enlargement , this is what we must build on . 
The solution - as proposed by the great majority - is more Europe , a stronger Europe; the Hungarian Presidency has been working for the last six months with this in mind . 
It is indeed our firm belief that deeper integration is the solution to our common problems . 
Finally , I would like to report on the issues which were given to the Hungarian Presidency as homework by the previous European Councils , and more specifically: what results and achievements will be presented at the summit starting tomorrow , because , after all , we had to make a deal about specific dossiers with you and we had to reach agreement on other issues as well . 
Let me start with economic issues . 
We have already talked about the European semester , and I would like to thank Vice-President Šefčovič , because it is really worth informing the public about what the semester means . 
It is about providing the transparency needed to know how Member States manage themselves , so that we may send them warning signals in time . 
I welcome the fact that the European Parliament followed this practice with close attention; in this European semester we encourage the Member States to maintain stricter budgetary management , and , at the same time , we lay down the basis for the practice of seeking growth in hard work and creativity . 
As far as the ' six-pack ' is concerned , there will be an in-depth debate on it soon in this House . 
Let me give you two reasons why I would prefer the adoption of the current agreement . 
Firstly , because this package is good . 
It is better than the initial Council proposal , and because Parliament was given concessions by the Council on every single issue on its agenda . 
We have even achieved concessions on reverse qualified majority voting . 
So , I have to disagree with Mr Lambsdorff ' s opinion that the whole package has only one tooth , namely reverse QMV . 
The advantage of this package is indeed that it builds several checks and balances into the system , through which crises like the one of 2008 can be avoided in the future . 
As far as free movement of persons is concerned , let me tell you that at the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 9 June the Hungarian Presidency unanimously adopted a conclusion stating that free movement has to be preserved , that we need to revise the measures already available to us , and only after we have exhausted them and only if new problems actually arise , requiring the adjustment of our current acquis , can we take extraordinary measures in extraordinary situations , and that the modalities should only be elaborated once there is a concrete legislative proposal at hand , which , as far as I know , will happen this autumn . 
I have just received news that parallel to this plenary session the Council agreed on the only open question regarding Frontex , so the negotiations on the strengthening of Frontex have been concluded with success . 
I thank Parliament for their cooperation . 
The other homework given by the European Council was to increase the lending capacity of the European Investment Bank , and in this regard we were able to come to an agreement with this Parliament , which is another success we achieved , and I believe this was an important step towards the reconciliation of the situation in the countries of North Africa . 
As a quick side note , I must respond to the words of Mr Tabajdi . 
I must reject his remarks concerning the members of the Hungarian Government , which I think are based on domestic political motivations . 
First , I would like to ask you to inquire from your colleagues in the Parliament ' s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs about the work of Minister for National Economy György Matolcsy , because the atmosphere in the hearing yesterday was slightly different from what you have talked about here today . 
I would also recommend that you read the responses of the Member States to the Commission ' s proposals concerning the European semester . 
Everyone is free to react and criticise the content , because everything works out through debates and interchanges of opinions in the European Union , and it is true that many Member States have criticised the content already . 
Second , I would like to point out to you one of the positive traits of the Hungarian Presidency , the key to our success in reaching agreements with European institutions on so many issues , namely respect for the Treaties and for the competence of the institutions . 
We submit the ' six-pack ' to the Council in the knowledge that the Hungarian Presidency has done everything it could to come to an agreement , as praised by President Barroso and by your colleagues in this House in committee meetings . 
Therefore , we now submit the package to the European Council , whose President ' s name is Herman Van Rompuy , and who will decide on a course of action . 
Last but not least , I would like to talk about the accession of Croatia . 
As I said at the beginning , I am careful with the use of the word ' historical ' . 
However , in the case of Croatia I think we have indeed come to a historical moment , because we are sending a very important message to the Western Balkans , namely that they have a future in the European Union . 
I truly hope that the heads of EU Member States and governments will take the political decision tomorrow and the day after tomorrow about the accession of Croatia , and that the negotiations can be concluded in the final hours of the Hungarian Presidency , on 30 June at the latest . 
The European Commission worked around the clock to be able to issue a positive report on 10 June . 
I can assure you that both the Croatians and the Hungarian Presidency have been working day and night to make this happen . 
We have had Council working group meetings every day to enable us to complete the work . 
Finally , I would like to thank not only this House - which I have done already - but also our partners in the trio , Spain and Belgium , for their excellent cooperation and for the fact that we were able to complete the 18-month trio programme , and may I wish Poland all the best and a Parliament-friendly Presidency . 
The debate is closed . 
Written Statements (Rule 149)
The forthcoming European Council is of particular importance because the two great facets of European integration will be at the heart of the debates . 
The first is economic integration in the shape of the economic governance package , which should make it possible to find the best solutions for getting out of the economic and financial crisis , as well as concrete measures for the countries in especially difficult economic situations; to this end the Council should send out a clear message of solidarity and responsibility . 
Secondly , this period of troubles and great migratory pressures that we are experiencing cannot serve as an excuse for weakening the great success of Schengen , a synonym for freedom of movement . 
We cannot do a U-turn on this success , but instead we must protect , strengthen and develop it . 
I hope this Council sends out a strong , clear message to this effect , emphasising that the Member States need to respect and implement the Schengen rules properly and effectively . 
It must draw attention to the need to improve solidarity and the sharing of responsibilities among Member States , and to increase the powers and resources of Frontex . 
It must also stress the need to set up a real evaluation mechanism for Schengen that will check compliance with the rules and border controls , identify problems , help solve them and , as a last resort , penalise Member States if they persist in not complying . 
The dramatic effects of the so-called austerity measures are highly visible . 
As many people warned a year ago , the International Monetary Fund-European Union (IMF-EU) programme for Greece has not only caused economic disaster and social devastation , but it has proved incapable of fulfilling the very objectives that allegedly justified it: the deficit reduction targets have not been met , the country ' s public debt must be around 170% at the moment and the interest rates that the markets require on the public debt have soared . 
Nonetheless , the European Council is preparing a fresh assault . 
In addition to the identically tailored IMF-EU programmes that they want to implement in Ireland and now Portugal , they are preparing to reinforce the attack on Greece , squeezing its people even further . 
These are the latest steps in this process of interference and extortion , which is openly colonial in complexion . 
They intend to use economic governance to institutionalise and make permanent the interventionist policies and measures associated with current , ongoing examples of IMF-EU meddling . 
They want ' cross-compliance ' to become permanent , as well as external control over national accounts and policies , which are closely supervised by the major EU powers . 
Infringement (or even a mere threat of infringement) of their dictates would result in heavy penalties . 
These are unacceptable developments that show how retrograde , reactionary and anti-democratic this European Union really is . 
We are at a crucial moment , when Europe ' s economic future is being decided in the shape of the economic governance package . 
Furthermore , in several days ' time the EU will decide on the next tranche of economic aid for Greece . 
In my opinion , if we are to exit the crisis then we need greater economic integration within Europe , not additional sanctions or restrictions . 
Today ' s European Union comprises both the euro area and the remaining countries , and while the euro area itself admittedly shares one currency , it is also made up of 17 bond markets and 17 governments ' development strategies . 
My political group , the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament , is therefore in favour of adopting positive solutions , such as closer economic integration . 
We also believe that the burden should fall on those who are responsible for the economic crisis , hence the idea of a tax on financial transactions , and not those who are its victims , for example the citizens of Greece . 
The current European Council meeting is also the last during the Hungarian Presidency of the Council , which has not earned the praise that should be due to it , since a number of concrete projects on the EU ' s agenda upon which the Hungarians have worked , including those concerning economic governance , have been overshadowed by political issues , such as the media law or the Hungarian constitution . 
I hope that Poland , which is next in line to take over the presidency , will not follow the example of our neighbours , and that the election campaign for the Sejm will not overshadow its successes . 
I am wondering what the outcome of this Council will be . 
It is supposed to be an opportunity to debate the progress made in the application of asylum and immigration policies , and the consequences of the Arab revolutions , at Europe ' s borders . 
If we have chosen to seize this opportunity in order to strengthen external border checks , then it should be said straight away that we have picked the wrong target again . 
It is not enough simply to pursue a repressive policy which we know is ineffective and causes great human suffering . 
Let us remember that there are people in need of protection at Europe ' s doors , doors which remain closed to them under the false pretexts of cost and abuse . 
Following the recent World Refugee Day , let us insist , above all , on our responsibilities as Europeans , responsibilities which the Member States are , wrongly , afraid to shoulder . 
Otherwise the 2012 deadline , to which those same Member States have committed themselves , may well be missed . 
in writing . - We are preparing for a busy European Council meeting which will , in my opinion , be even of historic importance . 
The Hungarian Presidency has some important success stories under its belt: the Danube strategy and the adoption of the Roma strategy . 
However , I do hope that after the good quality work they have done on a professional level , they will have enough political weight and agility to reach important goals in other areas , such as the Croatian accession , migration and the very pressing issue of economic governance . 
They have to work hard to achieve an understanding between 27 Member States , to reflect Europe ' s unity and willingness to overcome the crisis and preserve the essence of European integration . 
I am impressed that my country ' s first EU Presidency happens to be during such a challenging period and I hope that the European Council this week will live up to the expectations . 
in writing . - (DE) Whereas the immigration world champion Canada attracts more highly qualified migrants than any other region of the world - in which regard , those who are not able to make a living are also quick to leave again - Europe almost pursues a policy of ' compassionate migration for the unqualified ' . 
The fact is that the majority of Africans who come to Europe are not refugees , they are economic migrants . 
This human horse trading under the false heading of ' refugees ' as well as the humanitarian call for asylum is causing irreparable damage to the asylum system . 
A European asylum policy is doomed to failure on account of the undesirable side effects of previous proposals: the Dublin Regulation was intended to prevent asylum tourism . 
Now , countries with easily accessible external borders are swamped , but the majority of asylum seekers nevertheless are landing in the countries with the most generous social security systems . 
The fact that granting asylum seekers equality with the national population in terms of access to the labour market and social security has boosted economic migration was only to be expected . 
The increased rights of illegal immigrants make deportation almost impossible . 
A uniform asylum law would only be desirable if it was based on the most stringent national asylum law , like that of Denmark for example , and if there were consequences for contraventions of the law , like the tourist visa for illegal immigrants . 
A European asylum system based on the central principles of humanitarianism and muddling through is to be firmly rejected . 
There must finally be a clear differentiation between refugees with a right to asylum and economic migrants . 
Moreover , Frontex and readmission agreements must be developed further and illegal immigrants must consistently be deported . 
In view of the European Council meeting on 23-24 June , I would like to raise the issue of Croatia ' s accession . 
I would first of all like to say how pleased I am that my position , supported by an amendment to the resolution on the 2010 progress report for Croatia , tabled along with my colleague Bernd Posselt , is in the process of becoming a reality . 
This is why I welcome the agreement reached within the General Affairs Council on concluding negotiations with Croatia by the end of this month . 
I hope that the European Council will formalise this matter . 
After six years of negotiations , the time has come for recognition to be given to Croatia ' s efforts in meeting the accession criteria . 
I hope that in 2013 we can welcome Croatia as the 28th Member State . 
The Council ' s decision will send an extremely strong signal to the Western Balkans as a whole , encouraging the governments in this region to continue their reforms . 
This is a long process which requires sacrifices to be made . 
However , the integration efforts are rewarded in the end . 
At the same time , I welcome the positive attitude shown by the Croatian authorities to the use of the monitoring mechanism up until the actual time of accession as an additional incentive . 
However , there should be no option for extending its use after this date . 
The Schengen area will be one of the issues discussed at the Council ' s forthcoming meeting . 
In this context , I would like to draw the House ' s attention to the ever-increasing number of people talking about the reintroduction of border checks . 
Denmark was planning to take a decision to this effect . 
The reasons given , namely the fight against cross-border crime and the increase in illegal immigration , are very serious problems , but they cannot be solved by closing the borders . 
This course of action runs counter to EU regulations on the free movement of goods and services . 
It will also result in a rise in xenophobia and a growth in the influence of parties proclaiming populist and nationalist slogans . 
What we need most of all is joint and more effective solutions for protecting the EU ' s external borders and uniform standards for all Member States as far as immigration policy is concerned . 
In this context , I would call on the European Commission either to uphold its resolute opposition to a reintroduction of border checks or to establish joint , uniform and reasonable rules , criteria and mechanisms for a possible reintroduction . 
in writing . - (RO) First of all , I share the sentiments of my fellow Members maintaining that we should show solidarity with Greece . 
The European Union must take a firm , united stance on this decision . 
Secondly , the Schengen area is one of the EU ' s biggest achievements , the principles of which must be observed and defended . 
In this context , I think that restoring border controls within the Schengen area is not acceptable , nor is the introduction of additional criteria for Member States which would like to join the Schengen area and fulfil the specific technical criteria . 
Thirdly , I welcome the European Council ' s adoption of the EU Strategy for the Danube Region . 
There is a long history of cooperation in the Danube region . 
One of the first European institutions , the European Danube Commission , was founded in 1856 , with its headquarters in Galaţi , in Romania , its aim being to ensure freedom of navigation on the Danube . 
I call on the relevant Member States to give priority to the implementation of this strategy , thereby ensuring economic and social development for more than 120 million citizens living in this macro-region . 
Finally , I call on the European Council and Member States to remove the current barriers preventing the free movement of Romanian and Bulgarian workers . 
Lifting these barriers means respect for the EU ' s fundamental principles such as the free movement of persons and solidarity . 
in writing . - (DE) The European Council has a few things planned for the agenda of its meeting . 
With regard to the Greek crisis , it is finally to be made clear that the European Union does not just stand for ' give ' or ' take ' but that it works on the principle of ' give and take ' . 
However , that also means that if a country receives help , this country must also follow the measures that are put in place for this purpose . 
The improvement of the Stability and Growth Pact is very much to be welcomed , simply to prevent any further financial disasters being experienced by a Member State . 
With regard to the planned accession of Croatia , the fact that Croatia fulfils the accession criteria is something to be welcomed , but it nevertheless has to be asked how the funding of approximately EUR 500 million to which Croatia is entitled is actually to be financed . 
The CAP towards 2020: Meeting the food , natural resources and territorial challenges of the future (debate)
The next item is the report by Mr Dess , on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , on the CAP towards 2020: meeting the food , natural resources and territorial challenges of the future . 
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , 50 years ago , in 1961 , I began my training to be a farmer . 
Ever since then , I have been guided by the common European agricultural policy . 
It has become an important mainstay of the European unification process . 
Since the beginning of the CAP there have been fundamental changes to its tasks . 
The first task was to increase food production in order for us to be less dependent on food imports . 
Sometime later , Europe was in the position of having to deal with food surpluses . 
With an ever-changing situation , there were also more and more reforms . 
Today , we are debating the next reform , the new approach of the CAP after 2013 . 
As rapporteur for the CAP reform towards 2020 , I am pleased that we have achieved a cross-group compromise . 
Even if not all of the individual interests could be taken into account in a compromise , the report was adopted with a large majority in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development . 
The clear vote is an unambiguous signal to the Commission of the form that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development sees the CAP taking towards 2020 . 
I am certain , Commissioner , that the new approach of the CAP after 2013 will also bear the stamp of the European Parliament . 
The Treaty of Lisbon gives us that possibility . 
My thanks today go to my fellow Members for their involvement and support , and to the committee chair Mr De Castro , the coordinators and the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent cooperation and willingness to compromise . 
I would like to thank the staff of the committee secretariat , the political groups and in my own private office for their splendid cooperation . 
Turning to the report now: food safety and the security of supply for half a billion people remain the main goals of the common agricultural policy , not only in the EU , but also worldwide . 
The CAP is intended to be sustainable and competitive , to supply consumers with safe , high-quality food and also to promote renewable forms of energy . 
The two-pillar structure of the CAP is to remain so as to create certainty of planning for our farmers for this next period . 
The report clearly states - and here we support the Commissioner - that the agricultural budget should remain at the current level in the next financial period . 
I cannot understand President Barroso ' s statement that massive cuts are to be made in the second pillar . 
I believe that there will be cross-group opposition to this . 
The simplification of the common agricultural policy remains an important task . 
That is a core demand of our compromise . 
We are also calling for a fair distribution among the Member States . 
That is also necessary in order to create a level playing field in terms of competition . 
We are seeking to move away from historical and individual references towards area-based premiums . 
The role of small farmers is to be recognised and , on the basis of subsidiarity , the Member States are to decide themselves how to support these small farmers . 
The importance of young farmers is mentioned . 
From my point of view , it was important to avoid introducing a new additional payment system that would lead to extra control and sanction systems for greening . 
Overall , we have found a compromise that many Members will be able to support tomorrow so that we can send out a clear signal as regards the new approach of this agricultural policy . 
A large majority of the Group of the European People ' s Party (Christian Democrats) will support this report . 
Mr President , Mr Dess , honourable Members , this report has come at a pivotal time , just as the Commission is drafting detailed legislative proposals that it plans to present to Parliament and the Council in October . 
I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Dess , for his work over past weeks and months . 
I would also like to thank the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for their hard work and the fruitful discussions that we have had since I began the task of preparing the reform of the common agricultural policy . 
Many elements in the report are in line with the Commission ' s vision as set out in the communication on reforming the common agricultural policy , which was presented at the end of 2010 and was intended to spark debate . 
I am thinking in particular of the question of food security , which is one of agriculture ' s underlying aims . 
I am also thinking of the importance of preserving the two pillars of the common agricultural policy , as Mr Dess has just said , whilst also recognising the need to make the policy greener and to focus more on integrating the sound management of natural resources . 
I am also referring to a fairer distribution of common agricultural policy money between European farmers and to the need for a budget that is able to address food and regional issues , but also the management of natural resources in the European Union . 
I also note that you have included a proposal for higher ceilings for direct payments . 
At this stage , let me stress the considerable contribution that many large farms make to rural employment . 
Criteria such as employment will therefore be taken into account when we define the ceilings for agricultural income aid . 
Adding a green component to the first pillar in conjunction with a stronger rural development policy is another key objective that will help to tackle climate change and environmental issues , but will also contribute to achieving the Europe 2020 strategy . 
I am pleased to see that the report stresses the importance of closer links between direct payments and conservation of natural resources . 
I want to establish an effective , pan-European instrument that achieves the objective of simplifying the direct payment system . 
I am a strong advocate of decoupling direct payments , which has proved beneficial in helping farmers to adapt better to market conditions . 
However , I share the view expressed in your report , namely that we need to be practical and realistic . 
In certain situations , specific segments and sectors that are economically , ecologically and socially sensitive , I feel that optional coupled aid should also be available . 
Direct payments will continue to play an important role in maintaining regional vitality . 
This is a particular challenge in areas with significant natural limitations . 
That is why the Commission communication stressed the value of providing income aid in addition to the second pillar payments made to areas with natural constraints , which will continue to be awarded . 
We will examine the concerns expressed in your report , which suggests that this component should not be included under the first pillar . 
In the communication on the future of the common agricultural policy , I suggested creating a specific support scheme for small farmers , which would help them by minimising the administrative red tape associated with direct aid . 
Under the second pillar , small farmers could also receive significant support for restructuring or to allow them to contribute more at a territorial level , but also in economic terms , by becoming more profitable and more competitive . 
Limiting direct payments to active farmers is another point on which your expectations and my vision of the future common agricultural policy coincide . 
Here again , we want to establish a European definition that can also allow for the specific conditions in Member States . 
I have also paid close attention to your proposals on market measures . 
Strengthening management capacity and the negotiating power of producers and producer organisations , transparent pricing and other risk-management measures are all subjects that I am committed to examining in detail as part of the impact assessment . 
I intend to develop specific legislative proposals on these points . 
I agree with your comments on improving and enhancing rural development measures . 
I also agree that we need measures that will allow us to respond more effectively to challenges associated with global warming , biodiversity and the sustainable management of natural resources . 
The second pillar of the future common agricultural policy will have to address all these challenges and will also have to consider how technical knowledge can be used to build a future that combines competitiveness and environmental concerns . 
I can tell you that the entire Commission - the full College of Commissioners , including President Barroso - is in favour of a strong second pillar in the future common agricultural policy . 
I was interested to read your proposals regarding young farmers . 
Rural development policy must provide a wide range of support measures that will meet their needs . 
I would also like to consider what could be done under the first pillar of the common agricultural policy for young farmers . 
In future , I would like Member States to be able to define thematic sub-programmes: packages of measures which specifically target young farmers and recognise that they are a priority group in the Member State . 
I am thinking of measures for setting up , vocational training , training services , investing in modernisation and restructuring farms . 
As you emphasise in your report , our policy will need adequate funding if it is to address future challenges . 
We are currently waiting for the Commission communication on the next multiannual financial framework , which will be published by the end of June . 
We will build on that communication when we present our impact assessment and legislative proposals in the autumn , as I said . 
Thank you once again for this report . 
I am happy to answer any questions . 
I hope that this will be a very productive discussion . 
Mr President , Commissioner , today we are debating the common agricultural policy . 
A lot of people criticise the common agricultural policy , because they believe that it has caused environmental damage and has in the past and even today continues to put developing countries at risk on numerous counts , especially in terms of agriculture and development . 
Those who levy this criticism are right , but those calling for a reduction in funding for the common agricultural policy are wrong . 
The common agricultural policy is not just a policy for agriculture; it is an instrument for redistributing resources from the towns of Europe to the countryside . 
It is the European citizens in the countryside who take care of our forests , rivers and lakes and who give us food , clean air and water . 
We need to provide incentives for them to make changes where changes are needed . 
However , if we want to apply serious policy , we should increase funding for our agricultural policy , for a fairer , more effective and more viable common agricultural policy . 
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety . - (DE) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , if we were to ask European citizens what they expect from European politics they would answer quality of life , using terms like health and environment . 
With this common agricultural policy , we are facing precisely this task of fulfilling these expectations of European citizens in us as politicians , but also in politics in general . 
The contribution from the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety is an important one in this context , because we want the same things European citizens do . 
We want wholesome food produced in a diverse system , and by diverse I do mean biological diversity , but also diversity in terms of production . 
We must enable the preservation of the environment in which we live . 
We need to take care of our water bodies , the air and the soil . 
We need to ensure that the rural habitat continues to be developed and does not become the poorhouse of Europe . 
We need to pursue an agricultural policy that involves the development of all regions . 
We need money for this and we need the money to be properly and fairly distributed . 
Mr President , my apologies ! 
Please start timing . 
I wish to present a number of comments from the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development . 
It is a shame that they were not fully incorporated into the report of the Committee on Agriculture . 
They are as follows . 
Food security at EU and global level and globalisation necessitate a new and strong common agricultural policy , which will firstly improve our competitiveness on the international market , secondly ensure a fair income for farmers , thirdly ensure that consumers can buy high-quality products at fair prices , fourthly ensure the sustainable development of rural areas and fifthly help to improve the state of the environment . 
In order to accomplish these tasks , objective , transparent and simplified criteria need to be established , which guarantee equal support for farmers in all Member States under the direct payments system . 
It is time to move away from the use of historical payments . 
The CAP should incorporate measures for regulation of and intervention in the agricultural market , and a risk management mechanism . 
Finally , the CAP should pay more attention to small , family-owned agricultural holdings , given the need for diversification to . . . 
(The President cut off the speaker)
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , let me begin by congratulating our rapporteur , Mr Dess , the shadow rapporteurs and other contributors on the work that they have done to draft this text . 
In my opinion , it is both balanced and ambitious . 
We will be voting on the report tomorrow . 
Almost six months after Mr Lyon drafted his report setting out the European Parliament ' s views on the common agricultural policy (CAP) post-2013 , the European Commission decided to draw on the report by including many of its ideas in the communication issued on 18 November 2010 . 
The new report , which was adopted almost unanimously by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , affirms the new direction that we would like the common agricultural policy to take in the coming years . 
Our farmers are not there to produce mere commodities , or wares to sell . 
They are there , above all , to produce food for Europe ' s 500 million citizens , but also to help to feed the rest of the world . 
Stating it in these terms is not just semantics: it is a philosophical choice that we are making . 
Mr Dess ' s report endorses a positive approach to agriculture ' s environmental and ecological contribution and therefore appeals for a reduction of the often onerous administrative procedures generated by European and national legislation . 
By arguing in favour of graduated direct payments and a review of the regulatory instruments , the report also provides a new perspective on social perception of the CAP and of global trade . 
As we speak , the G20 in Paris is beginning discussions on regulating the global commodities markets , with particular reference to agricultural commodities . 
Parliament ' s approach , then , has not been defined in a vacuum , where we are cut off from the world . 
Rather , it is part of the wider deliberations on how to come up with a global response to a global challenge . 
As with Mr Lyon ' s report one year ago and Mr Garriga Polledo ' s report on the financial perspectives last month , tomorrow we will be voting in favour of maintaining the agricultural budget for the 2014-2020 programming period . 
I am sure that it will be a close-run thing , but we do need to take a stand and to make choices , because we will not have the money to do everything . . . 
(The President cut off the speaker)
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr Dess , Mr Dantin was cut off , but he was going to explain that the global food challenge is important , and it is important . 
As has already been said , this report , together with previous reports and the Commission ' s communication , seeks to demonstrate that Europe ' s aim is to have a common agricultural policy that guarantees food security in Europe and contributes to global food security . 
That entails political commitments on market regulation , which is what is under discussion today . 
We too will have to push for this in our debates at EU level . 
At a time when there are plans to eliminate Europe ' s food security programme , we need to remember that food security is still a matter of solidarity and is still extremely topical in Europe: almost 30 million Europeans are currently suffering from malnutrition . 
Let us not lose sight of that fact . 
Essentially , this report sets out the broad thrust: the greening of agricultural policy . 
Of course farming needs to take a positive approach to environmental issues . 
In particular , it needs to focus on the European element and ensure that it is factored in by incorporating environmental issues into the first pillar . 
Another important point is that this compromise is the result of lengthy negotiations , in which I have always been involved , on the question of graduated support . 
At long last , support will be allocated in accordance with two criteria: employment - I believe that agricultural policy needs to allow for the notion of providing employment - and , of course , the production of public goods . 
This approach is better than continuing the debate on aid ceilings and never coming up with any solutions . 
I am making the point this afternoon because it is my honest opinion . 
Let me conclude by saying that this report and Parliament ' s commitment are pointless unless the agriculture budget remains at its current level . 
That is my response to the comments made by the Commissioner and the President of the Commission on the second pillar . 
We cannot accept a budget cut . 
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , I think the world-renowned Scottish poet Rabbie Burns might have described this report as a bit of a ' cow ' rin , tim ' rous beastie ' in its original form . 
Thankfully , through the good work that Albert Dess and all the other shadow rapporteurs have put in over the last months of negotiations , we now have a report that has some real substance and one that has many areas that we can support . 
I believe , however , that it falls short in one important area , in that it fails to answer the fundamental question asked by our taxpayers and our consumers who pay for the common agricultural policy: what are the direct decoupled payments for ? 
That is a fundamental question that we all need to face up to . 
There is no longer any linkage with food production because they are decoupled . 
There is a link to public goods through cross-compliance , but I do not think this fundamentally answers that question . 
I believe that the report should perhaps have gone a little further in responding to that question by backing the idea of a more targeted direct payment , containing a major incentive to develop a more sustainable and competitive model of agriculture , and giving the possibility of a targeting of payments at LFA areas - the so-called greening of the direct payments , which I believe the Commissioner is very much favour of . 
If we move down that road , I believe it gives us the ability to respond to that question and explain to the public exactly what direct payments are for . 
It also negates the call for caps and ceilings to be put on aids because , if there are public goods attached to the direct payments across all the direct payments , then the bigger the farmer , the more public goods that farmer will deliver . 
So there is no need to cap them . 
I believe that the report hints at that direction and I welcome the move towards that type of model . 
I hope we can improve the report tomorrow . 
If we do so , our group will certainly be happy to support it . 
on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , can I also take the opportunity to congratulate the rapporteur . 
He certainly proved during the time that negotiations were going on that he had a very big back indeed , because there were a lot of people throwing knives at him during that period . 
So he proved to be very resilient in his task , and he got there . 
The first thing I want to do is to welcome the fact that it is going to be a Pillar Two structure , because I think that is what we are all agreed on . 
I listened to the talk about greening . 
When you speak about greening it means different things to different people in different countries , including how it is applied . 
We have got to get our heads around this somehow . 
It is not a simple throw-away line that you can use in some way or other , because it is going to have a tremendous effect down the line . 
Mr Le Foll is right . 
If the money is not there at the end of the day , there is little we can do in many of these areas . 
We have got to be responsible , and we have got to be responsible as a Parliament as we move towards the legal text that the Commissioner will bring forward in the late autumn of this year . 
That is going to be a tremendous challenge for us in this Parliament . 
For the first time we are going to have a responsibility , a say , and be part of the final decision-making process . 
So from that point of view , I am opposed to the present text when it talks about capping . 
I will be supporting the amendments that have been put forward to reduce the degree . 
This is something that we have got to talk about more but , as I said , it will all be no good if the budget is not there . 
We have got to look at how we spend the money . 
Are we spending our money as wisely as we can ? 
Is there not too much of it going on administration ? 
Is there not too much going on bureaucracy and red tape ? 
And is not enough being given towards food security ? 
Again like greening , people talk about food security as a throw-away line . 
What are we doing to achieve food security ? 
We could be facing a crisis in the next nine or ten years . 
There are fewer farmers , fewer people working; this is where I think we have to concentrate in the future . 
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - (DE) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in our opinion , the report takes us clearly in the right direction . 
European agricultural policy needs to be fairer , and it needs to be fairer to the environment . 
I believe that we have achieved these objectives with the report . 
At the end of the day , European agricultural policy must meet our objectives on climate and diversity . 
This , too , is incorporated into the report . 
European agricultural policy needs to deliver environmental services . 
Then taxpayers will be prepared to pay for it . 
We need a fair distribution between farms , but also between the Member States , and we need to practise a fair trade policy towards less developed countries . 
This , too , is in the report . 
Working through nearly 1 300 amendments has been a laborious process , but in the long term we have achieved our aim of reaching a major common compromise with clearly defined objectives . 
Parliament has proved itself capable of making such policy . 
Many points could have been worded more clearly in our view , such as the terms for payments under the first pillar - crop rotation , protection of meadow land - but fine , it is now down to the Commission to flesh out the final arrangements . 
It is also important that degressivity is included . 
Large farms need to deliver more when it comes to jobs and the environment . 
This was supported by a large majority in committee . 
It is also important that the role of farmers in trade is enhanced , and it is also important that the matter of the protein deficit is addressed . 
In the long term we cannot afford to import from other countries protein crops equivalent to 30 million hectares of feed area . 
It is high time that we made a start on this . 
We are all agreed that a strong second pillar is important . 
Rural development , environmental measures and measures for less-favoured regions - there must be a clear emphasis on these . 
If Mr Barroso wishes to axe this point he will face huge opposition from Parliament . 
It is precisely here that the opportunities for rural development lie , and we cannot turn our backs on the less-favoured regions . 
Mr President , Commissioner , the report presented today outlines a new direction for the common agricultural policy . 
It includes graduated public funding that reflects employment and environmental considerations , the fact that agriculture produces public goods and the concept of active farmers . 
However , we have seen too many good intentions that have never improved life for working farmers . 
Let us bear in mind the scenes being acted out right now in our rural areas . 
Although the idea of a safety net is attractive , it is not enough . 
We need to return to public intervention mechanisms in order to guarantee basic prices for small and medium-sized farmers . 
Bringing together economic , social and ecological efficiencies will also put an end to the ultra-liberal free trade model that is currently destroying family farms . 
The European Union needs to strive for radical changes in the World Trade Organisation and to work more closely with the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) so as to return to cooperation systems that include variable customs duties at the border . 
We also need far more research funding in Europe . 
Lastly , we need to ensure that the budget for the policy is maintained . . . 
(The speaker concluded off-microphone)
Mr President , we could not hear the English interpretation of the previous speech . 
I was very interested in it and , if it is not too much of a burden on the speaker , and if you can do something so we can hear it in English , I would very much appreciate it . 
Did anyone else not hear the English interpretation ? 
Perhaps it is just a local problem in the back rows . 
We are looking into the matter . 
Apparently it was a channel mix-up . 
We are working on the problem . 
Please bear with us , but I am sure the speech can be read afterwards on the web . 
We have web streaming and I am sure the interpretation will be there . 
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first of all I must thank and congratulate Mr Dess on the hard work he has put in , together with all the shadow rapporteurs . 
We are particularly pleased that there are references in this report to less-favoured areas - mountainous areas are specially close to our hearts . 
We are particularly pleased that there is support for small farms , which are fundamental because they are of great importance both for protecting the land and for the quality of the products produced on them . 
We are also particularly pleased that there are substantial references to young farmers , who to some extent represent the future of agriculture . 
We should all be aware , however , that a major battle must now be fought over the budget , which is why we are appealing to you , Commissioner , as you know it better than I or anyone else here does . 
We cannot allow the common agricultural policy (CAP) to have its budget cut , because that would mean that agriculture is probably worth less in Europe . 
Clearly , if agriculture is worth less in Europe , then agricultural products and hence all our food is also worth less . 
That is not what we think , of course . 
Lastly , Commissioner , I would like to mention the issue of imports . 
As you know , imports do not of course come into the CAP , but they make up another essential piece of the jigsaw that should go alongside the CAP , because if we import cheap , poor-quality products our agriculture is bound to collapse . 
Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Dess for a comprehensive report . 
Like other speakers , I would like to emphasise the importance of an adequate budget for the new CAP . 
I believe that it is hugely important to base our budget on the arguments around food security . 
It is estimated that , by 2050 , we will need a 70% increase in global agricultural production . 
I would argue that the new CAP should aid this and keep that production within Europe . 
We should not be doing anything to hamper the food production base that we already have . 
I welcome the clear support for the two-pillar structure and I also welcome today ' s affirmation from the Commissioner of his support for that as well . 
However , I would have to add that I do not want to see the support for greening in Pillar One imposing further burdens and costs on our farmers . 
For that reason I would like to see flexibility at national and regional level , given the wide diversity of farm structures and land bases across the EU . 
(IT) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the hard work done by the rapporteur , Mr Dess , and the shadow rapporteurs - and I congratulate them all , of course - is today entering its final stage . 
A new common agricultural policy (CAP) means a lot to Europe for the future of its agriculture and the survival of vast rural areas . 
The new CAP must enable people to enjoy an adequate supply of quality food , as well as being able to sustain the production of non-marketable public assets . 
To achieve the goals indicated , there is a need for further , more effective and especially simpler instruments for farmers , together with easier access to funding and less red tape . 
We also need market instruments to combat effectively the unfortunately recurrent crises , and also instruments to prevent and insure against the risks inherent to agriculture . 
We need a CAP for young people , to whom we can entrust the agriculture of the future . 
We have decided to promote protection of biodiversity and of the countless regional and production specificities of the European Union through a rural development policy that will enhance all the natural and human potential of rural areas . 
At the same time we must seek to make farming businesses competitive . 
That is why I would like to impress on the Commission the need to include technology transfer measures in rural development . 
As approved in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , I confirm the importance of supporting the introduction of ceilings for direct payments awarded to large economic players . 
I think the introduction of a system of degressivity of aid as the size of a holding increases above a certain threshold is necessary to avoid overcompensating larger holdings that already enjoy major economies of scale . 
I cannot avoid underlining the need for adequate financing for the CAP . 
This House cannot accept a rural development funding cut . 
(PT) Madam President , with this reform we in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament want to make the common agricultural policy (CAP) fairer , more equitable and more suited to the times in which we live , when the issues of the legitimacy of aid in relation to society and of food safety and food security in the broadest sense are more relevant than ever . 
We have succeeded in seeing our main concerns included in this report . 
They include the need to maintain an adequately funded common agricultural policy for the Union . 
I must stress that we shall not agree to the withdrawal of any financial resources in order to guarantee the enforcement of the CAP . 
We want a fairer distribution of aid both among Member States and among farmers , through the introduction of a new system not linked to production but based on environmental and social criteria; that is to say , one that promotes employment . 
We must also orient the CAP towards real farmers and create a specific mechanism for small farmers . 
I am sure that with Parliament ' s strengthened role under the Treaty of Lisbon we will be able to translate these goals , which for now are merely theoretical , into concrete actions . 
(SV) Madam President , I would like to thank Mr Dess for his excellent work . 
I would like to talk about one aspect of agricultural policy . 
That is the enormous challenges that humanity and the whole world are facing . 
These include the climate , biodiversity and the eutrophication of waterways . 
There are all sorts of examples I could give here . 
In this context , I think that we need to realise that it is farmers who manage our environment and the prerequisites for our lives and our futures on a day-to-day basis . 
It is in agriculture and forestry that we have the best tools and it is for the use of these environmental tools that farmers should be paid , and they should be paid well for this . 
I would therefore like us in future to change our thinking somewhat and move away from income subsidies , which are difficult to account for , and ensure that we pay for the job that farmers do . 
In other words , we should stop paying subsidies and start paying for the services provided . 
The most important task for agriculture is , of course , to produce food - sufficient , good-quality food - but my view is that food should be paid for on the market . 
Environmental services cannot be paid for there . 
(PL) Madam President , in many respects the Dess report is very good , but in one respect it is quite the opposite , since it rejects the idea of a fair equalisation of direct payments . 
The bizarre and absurd principle whereby more assistance is given to those who are richer and less to those who are poorer is to continue to hold sway in the agricultural sector . 
The farmers in the new Member States , and not only the farmers , are extremely worried and alarmed by these developments . 
The agricultural sector is in decline , particularly in the new Member States . 
I would ask you to look at how much land is lying fallow in Poland , Lithuania and Slovakia . 
I would call on my fellow Members from the old Member States to end this discrimination . 
Let us finally equalise direct payments fairly , and let us not create a two-speed Europe . 
I should like to address the French Members of the House in particular to remind them of the slogan of ' liberty , equality , fraternity ' which adorned the banners of the French revolution . 
We have liberty , but we do not have equality , and without equality there can be no fraternity . 
Let us demand equality . 
(FR) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I do agree that , as well as liberty and fraternity , there should be equality for farmers and the new Member States in Eastern Europe . 
Yes , I agree with you . 
I think that this report marks a huge step forward . 
It was not easy at the outset: the situation was fairly confrontational . 
However , the important thing is that we reached a consensus . 
This consensus has allowed us to maintain the broader vision , and I believe that therein lies the European Parliament ' s great strength . 
We have succeeded , despite the difficulties , and I would therefore like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Dess , and all the Members . 
The first phase is complete . 
In this document , we have reiterated the need for equality , justice and fairness for producers and regions . 
I think that is important . 
We have clearly stated and confirmed that we want to safeguard and develop small farms , that we want small farms to be taken into account because they are essential to quality and regional biodiversity . 
In my opinion , this was another fundamental point . 
The idea of making agriculture more scientific , of moving away from productivist industrial farms , is now enshrined in the texts . 
We now need to make it a reality: only then will farming become a viable option for future generations . 
This is not a question of ideology . 
Lastly , at present , we are worried about the real budgetary threats . 
We need to come up with unequivocal responses . 
What we want now is to move into the second phase , which is obviously the legislative debate . 
Why ? 
Because we need more than texts and lofty intentions: it is in debating legislative proposals that we will really see where we are going . 
That is essentially what we are waiting for . 
Let me close , however , by expressing my fury at Germany ' s attitude . 
It has forced us to cut food aid to Europe ' s poorest citizens to one-fifth of the original amount . 
That aid was part of the common agricultural policy budget . 
I want to find another way of helping our poorest citizens: the 80 million Europeans who do not have enough to eat . 
(LV) Madam President , a great job has been done , but the completed report is couched in very general terms . 
The report clearly outlines a new direction - agricultural greening . 
This could be a form of lifebelt for non-productive farmers , who could avoid having to engage in agricultural production and yet receive area payments . 
In my view , we should , when applying this report in practice , bear in mind what is missing . 
The protein problem is missing , the issue of the quality of imported food has not been incorporated , there is no mention of the problem of genetically modified crops , and land degradation issues have been insufficiently addressed . 
There is still no clear definition of such terms as ' active farmer ' , ' new farmer ' , ' fair area payments ' , and ' family farms ' . 
Unfortunately , a great many farmers will find no answers to their problems and their questions in this report . 
In the future we must improve it . 
Madam President , whilst the term ' greening ' of Pillar One may appeal to armchair farmers , it will pose major problems to heavy-land farmers who could well abandon land rather than attempt to plant it in the spring . 
Had this policy been enforced this year , it would have resulted in total crop failures . 
Proper inspection and enforcement of greening measures will also be impossible . 
To be effective , the capping of single farm payments will need to be severe . 
This will immediately motivate farmers to formally split their businesses with their spouses so that the full payment is retained on both divisions . 
Added to that , I am informed that the savings made from capping will accrue to the EU and not the Member State that actually generated the savings . 
Cultivation of GM crops should be the decision of individual Member States . 
The suggestion that no single farm payment can be received by farmers who cultivate these crops is utterly nonsensical . 
The world is short of food . 
We should be encouraging the uptake of new farming technology and not vilifying it . 
I hope the last three winters will have convinced all of you that there is no threat to us from global warming . 
(HU) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , how different the opinion of the increasingly outraged European citizens would be about the European Union if they found that their tax contributions were spent exclusively as public money on public interest and for the public good , proportionate to the public good produced . 
The Dess report takes this direction in connection with the agricultural assistance provided by the European Union . 
Tomorrow we will bear immense responsibility in deciding whether to adopt the ceiling , the maximum that was determined by the Dess report as a result of the hard work of those who submitted motions for amendment , for hectare-based and area-based assistance . 
I would like to ask you to follow the sense of justice of your voters and adopt this ceiling . 
Let there be a cap on public money that the green and red barons and other urban businessmen receive from the European taxpayers ! 
(ES) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , though today ' s debate focuses on this important report on the reform of the common agricultural policy , I should like to comment on a side issue that affects us and could affect the viability of the postulates we are defending in Parliament in connection with the reform of the future of the CAP . 
Next week , the European Commission will present its proposal on the financial prospects for the post-2014 period , in which , if my information proves correct , the Community executive is decidedly intent on proposing cuts to the EU agricultural budget . 
It must therefore be borne in mind that the European Commission will not take on board the opinion that we will adopt tomorrow , in which we specifically request the expenditure of the common agricultural policy to be maintained . 
I fail to see how , with a reduced budget , we will be able to rise to all the challenges described in that document; how common agricultural policy subsidies will be made greener , a process we want to ensure will not require an additional effort on the part of agricultural and livestock farmers; how we will be able to achieve this . 
I fail to see how , with a diminished CAP , we will be able to respond - just to give another example - to price volatility , and establish a budget line , as is our intention , that will rise to the crisis we have come to know so well . 
The CAP should not be measured merely in terms of expenditure because , in addition to the goods and services it provides , I believe it should be made clear - today of all days - that EUR 1 invested in agriculture generates EUR 10 of wealth in the agri-food sector . 
This should be very much taken into account when it comes to setting the next budgetary framework . 
Furthermore , it should not be forgotten that negotiations with third countries and with the World Trade Organisation pose a serious threat to the future of agricultural and livestock production in the European Union . 
(IT) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the Dess report marks the beginning of a new phase in the common agricultural policy (CAP) reform process . 
It is the result of several months ' hard work by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , for which I would like to thank Mr Dess and all the shadow rapporteurs and parliamentary groups . 
Today this House can give a clear opinion on the future of the common agricultural policy: it must be a robust , simple , flexible and greener CAP that takes young people and employment into account . 
That , Commissioner , is why we are worried by the news in the press today about budget cuts , especially in the second pillar . 
That would be incompatible with both the Dess report and the report on the European Union ' s financial perspective by Mr Garriga Polledo , which we adopted in plenary in recent weeks . 
The latter report introduced the important principle for the CAP of maintaining the current level of funding in the next financial programming period . 
Therefore , Commissioner , we would like some clarification about the news that has been circulated , and we would like to know whether as far as you are concerned there are different guidelines from what we have been told up to now . 
(DE) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank the rapporteur for his persistent and positive work . 
Where the future of agricultural policy after 2013 is concerned , we have to decide the direction in which we want to go . 
Do we want an agricultural sector that faces up to the challenges by acting in an innovative , modern , courageous , self-aware , responsible and independent way in the market ? 
Or do we want an agricultural sector that continues to be drip-fed by Europe and which needs its hand to be held and encouraging words from Mummy with each step it takes into the future ? 
That is the course we are currently setting . 
To cope with the challenges of the future we need to promote modern technologies in the agricultural sector instead of having endless debates on ideologies . 
If farms are to be enabled to plan with certainty then we cannot keep changing course every couple of years . 
It is too much of a strain on our farmers ' finances . 
Everyone here must surely be aware that each political change of direction results in new laws and directives , which in turn demand investment by farms without at the same time increasing their incomes . 
We should not care whether a farm is large or small; instead we should be concerned with whether it is run in an economically sound manner . 
We should not care whether it produces conventionally or organically , so long as it handles resources responsibly . 
We should also not care how many animals are kept , so long as those animals are treated well . 
The important thing for us must be that we have sufficient good quality food in the future at affordable prices in Europe . 
After all , Europe is not alone in the world . 
(CS) Madam President , the day is finally approaching when a unified agricultural policy will apply in the old and new Member States , ending 10 years of discrimination against farmers from the new Member States . 
I very much welcome this development . 
I hope that no new discriminatory conditions will be imposed on farmers in the new programming period . 
Unfortunately , I have to say that the Dess report contains such a proposal . 
I am thinking primarily of support for the so-called capping of direct payments for larger agricultural undertakings . 
I regard such a course of action as discriminatory against Member States such as the Czech Republic , which , for historical reasons , have larger farms than elsewhere in the European Union . 
I therefore reject the idea of capping direct payments , since this is a move which will reduce the efficiency of agriculture throughout the European Union . 
The primary aim of agriculture has always been to produce food . 
Nowadays , however , a number of politicians , above all those from the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance and from the ranks of the left , want to turn farmers into biofuel manufacturers and anti-global warming warriors . 
I cannot support such developments . 
Madam President , I would echo group colleagues and other colleagues in adding my own congratulations to our rapporteur . 
This has not been an easy job for him - or indeed any of us - and the report before us has been much improved through joint working and has much to admire within it . 
I particularly like the idea of the continuation of direct payments and the explicit removal of the historical reference values in paragraph 15 and the fairer distribution between Member States , and within Member States in the regions and nations within them , in paragraph 16 . 
Coming from Scotland , I am particularly glad to see a strong statement in favour of less favoured areas in paragraph 82 . 
I know that farmers in Scotland - and everywhere else too - will be glad to see paragraph 44 , which contains an explicit statement that cross-compliance should be risk-based and proportional . 
Commissioner , perhaps you could mention that paragraph in particular to some of your auditor colleagues . 
While there is much to admire in this report , let us be honest with ourselves and with our voters . 
Unless we have paragraph 1 , all of this is pointless - and paragraph 1 , where we call for a strong and sustainable CAP with a budget commensurate with the ambitious objectives , will be pointless too . 
Like other colleagues , I wish to express my own concern , not least at today ' s rumours that President Barroso is looking to make swingeing cuts to the budget and Pillar Two in particular . 
Commissioner , you are going to need all the allies you can get in these discussions within the Commission and with the Member States . We must have a CAP that is properly funded and properly ambitious for our farmers and our citizens . 
European agriculture has a great story to tell . 
Now is not the time to fall out over minutiae . 
(GA) Madam President , I welcome Mr Dess ' s report on reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP) , and I thank him for his work . 
This week ' s vote will reflect what the European Parliament expects to see in the legislative proposals for the CAP . 
The budget vote , which is upcoming , is also extremely important for ensuring appropriate future funding for agriculture . 
We need to see a strong and sustainable CAP - based on two pillars - which will keep farmers on the land , ensure environmental protection , promote the rural economy and provide fairness and transparency for all those who work in the food chain . 
Greening events dealing with the environment in Pillar 1 must be clear , properly designed and easy to measure , and funding for Pillar 2 must be strong and fair . 
(IT) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , of all Europe ' s policies , the common agricultural policy is the one that has had to be updated the most over the years in order to cope with constant changes occurring on the economic front , including at international level . 
It has always been updated with two main goals in mind: guaranteeing an income for European farmers and dealing with an ever-decreasing EU budget , while not forgetting a whole host of other objectives linked to quality of production , of the environment , of biodiversity and of water resources . 
The CAP reform on which we will vote tomorrow is vital if we are to continue to support the income of our farmers , as my colleagues have already mentioned . 
The aim , then , is not to reduce direct subsidies but to find a balance between such subsidies and rural development , so that the system is rendered simpler and fairer , without the rules of competition being called into question . 
As regards the objectives of the CAP in the context of the Europe 2020 strategy , the CAP can contribute to the growth of a sustainable economy by responding well to new challenges and taking account of the diversity and richness of agriculture and the specific characteristics of the 27 Member States . 
(EL) Madam President , we obviously need a strong CAP . 
The agricultural sector provides clear added value to the European economy . 
It plays a multifunctional role , by contributing to the production of public goods for the benefit of society as a whole . 
The CAP budget must , at the very least , stay at current levels and similar resources and objectives must be safeguarded for the new CAP . 
The distribution of CAP resources between farmers in the European Union , which is at the top of the public dialogue agenda , requires care . 
The idea of a flat rate throughout the European Union is broadly opposed . 
In my opinion , we need objective criteria that take due account of the peculiarities of the agricultural sector in the individual EU Member States . 
The proposals to cap direct payments , pay special aid to small-scale farmers and only to pay aid to active farmers are a good idea . 
Agro-environmental measures should be easy to apply , should be flanked by adequate counterbalances and should not create any additional administrative burden . 
With widespread instability on agricultural markets , climate risks and a food crisis , we need to activate effective instruments . 
The current market measures need to be reinforced . 
We also need a permanent crisis management fund . 
The proposal for a new farm income stabilisation instrument is a good idea . 
Finally , I would highlight the need for effective measures for the benefit of young farmers . 
My thanks to the rapporteur , Mr Albert Dess , for a difficult and complicated job well done . 
Commissioner , any weakening of the CAP will come up against political opposition from the European Parliament . 
I think that this is the cross-party message of this House and serious account needs to be taken of it . 
(DE) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank the rapporteur and I am pleased that the report bears unmistakably socialist , social democratic hallmarks . 
We want a sustainable , ecological and social agricultural policy . 
We want greening and we want it in the first pillar . 
Cross-compliance and the agro-environmental measures of the system to date are not enough to achieve support for the whole of society , but that is precisely what we need . 
Our primary objective must be to ensure high-quality and sustainable food production in Europe and for our rural areas to be active and vital . 
We absolutely have to stop the increasing land abandonment , because we need people . 
People to look after the agricultural sector , as well as the areas upstream and downstream . 
The rumours emanating from the Commission concerning plans for massive cuts in rural development in the next multiannual financial framework are not acceptable . 
We must continue to work for a strong second pillar in the common agricultural policy (CAP) , for rural areas and for Europe . 
I would like to issue a general warning to anyone intending to cut agricultural funding . 
If this is done , there will be no reform . 
Everything will then stay the same as it is . 
That will be quite inexplicable to the citizens of Europe . 
Madam President , Parliament ' s demand to maintain , if not increase , the agricultural budget is in my view highly optimistic . 
These are tough times and budgets are not limitless . 
In my view , these proposals will need a reality check when the overall EU budget is determined some time next year . 
We have to get back to the real priorities of the common agricultural policy . 
Food security , food safety , biodiversity , climate change , new technologies and creating a viable , competitive market-led industry have to be the focus . 
In my view , the Commission ' s proposals have lost the direction which we had from the previous two reports . 
They lack focus and they are too complicated . 
I am happy to say that , in his proposals , Albert Dess has set out a very sensible framework in which we can develop future reform . 
(DE) Madam President , the report by Mr Dess is about giving consideration to protection of the environment and the climate in agriculture , as well as increasing the competitiveness of agriculture . 
We have negotiated good compromises on these points . 
I feel that we should speak out in favour of well thought through upper ceilings for farms , particularly when the recipients are multinational groups which sometimes receive sums that simply cannot be justified . 
The Group of the European People ' s Party (Christian Democrats) is firmly on the side of farmers when it comes to removing bureaucracy . 
The complete reorganisation of the systems and the associated introduction of additional checks , as called for by others , would make no sense whatsoever . 
We need to be quite clear about one thing: if consumers expect European agriculture to move further towards greening and sustainability , then the measures concerned have to be given the necessary financial resources . 
I am firmly opposed to cuts in the EU agricultural budget in the forthcoming budget period . 
As regards the press reports stating that Mr Barroso , the President of the Commission , wants to take an axe to rural development , I would state quite clearly that if the Commission cuts the programmes for rural development then it will be cutting off the lifeblood of rural areas . 
Well-functioning farming structures would be dramatically affected by cuts in the second pillar . 
Mr Barroso would be well advised to heed what this House is saying . 
The common agricultural policy is and remains a key area of Community policy and of the EU budget . 
We cannot impose additional constraints on our farms , which are facing increasing global competition , and at the same time reduce their support . 
On the contrary , investment subsidies under the second pillar will promote a keenness and a willingness for innovation . 
That will benefit everyone in rural areas . 
We must particularly implement measures in respect of young farmers , in order to secure the future of agriculture . 
Our future agricultural policy will decide whether or not Europe is self-sufficient in the future . 
(ES) Madam President , this afternoon ' s debate clearly reveals that this House supports and is indeed set on achieving a strong common agricultural policy that can rise to the challenges of food safety , environmental sustainability and employment in rural areas . 
If this is to be attained , we cannot allow - as , hopefully , will be upheld by this House - any cuts to the current CAP budget . 
We need to have sufficient funding to respond to these challenges . 
We have to be in a position that allows us to safeguard farmers ' incomes , and to put market mechanisms into place in order to prevent and avert price volatility such as we are currently seeing . 
Furthermore , I should not like to forget the events of the last few weeks in the fruit and vegetable sector , which are proof that the new CAP must also provide crisis-response instruments for all the sectors concerned , instruments that are efficient , expeditious and adapted to the needs of each individual sector . 
Madam President , thank you to Mr Dess for a very interesting and informative report . 
Inevitably , on an issue of this complexity , there are bits you agree with and bits you do not . 
With 42% of our European expenditure going on the CAP , it is vital that we provide complete accountability to our citizens . 
Most people , in the face of rising food prices - sharply rising food prices - and dire warnings about lack of supply , will be expecting to see a CAP which focuses clearly on increasing productivity and efficiency . 
Yes , we have to take care of the environment - I am a member of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety and we know that - but we are in real danger here of creating a report with a rhetoric moving into things like ' greening Pillar One ' ; we are talking about moving away from the real focus , which is efficiency . 
On that basis , I do not support the capping of payments to large farms . 
This move will be institutionalising inefficiency and there is no justification for it . 
(DE) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , as you have all done already , we must warmly thank our rapporteur for the commitment he has put into this report and also for his stamina in achieving these compromises . 
I am sure it was not easy , but we have achieved good compromises . 
We stand for competitive and sustainable agriculture in Europe . 
That means that our farmers produce food of the highest quality . 
However , we are also producing a cultural landscape that can be seen , that provides recreational spaces for you all , for all of us , for our society , that provides jobs not just in agriculture but also in tourism and in many other areas . 
That is a service that agriculture provides for society , but this is respected far too little by society - and sometimes also by us . 
It is an extensive service , and such an extensive service does not deserve to have the agricultural budget cut if it is at all possible . 
Commissioner , we support you in your approach of bringing more ecology and more greening into the first pillar . 
However , this must not result in those countries and those farmers which already have very ambitious environmental programmes in the second pillar being discriminated against by this new approach . 
A solution needs to be found here that is fair to both sides . 
Environmental programmes are expensive . 
When I read in the newspapers - as has been mentioned already by many Members - that cuts are to be made in the second pillar , I reject it vehemently . 
We need a strong first pillar . 
We also need - and have spoken out in favour of this - a strong second pillar . 
We will support you , Commissioner , in these efforts . 
(HU) Madam President , Commissioner , Parliament , the Commission and the Council all agree in that the budget of the CAP should be appropriate and should be maintained at least at the current level . 
It is important to keep the two-pillar structure , to maintain direct payments and especially the strong rural development policy , and to improve competitiveness and strengthen environmental awareness . 
Innovation , research and development are of key importance as well . 
Environmental public goods and technologies that reduce the effects of climate change and enhance biodiversity and water management should be the focus of rural development . 
Further financial assistance is needed in the future as well to help new Member States close the gap and ensure that they can access rural development aid with better co-financing conditions post-2013 , as well . 
It is important to provide equal competitive conditions and equal opportunities for the new Member States from 2014 . 
And finally , it is important not to play off large farms and small-sized producers against each other . 
(FR) Madam President , let us admit that it looked like we were heading for disaster with 1 267 amendments . 
The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament has therefore chosen to table as few amendments as possible . 
We are proud to stand strong and united with our shadow rapporteur , Mr Le Foll . 
We are also pleased to have worked together with other groups and the rapporteur to produce an ambitious compromise . 
In my view , it is vital that aid should be allocated primarily to active farmers , rather than to landowners . 
This will foster food security , but also agriculture which is more sustainable and environmentally friendly and which ensures better management of resources and contributes to combating climate change . 
In addition , we are delighted to see that the greening component will be a compulsory part of the first pillar , while direct payments will be shared out more evenly between individual Member States and different agricultural sectors . 
In a historic first , we have created a degressive support system based on criteria linked to employment and environmental considerations . 
As for young farmers , support measures and incentives have been introduced to help and encourage them to set up farms . 
Essentially , we have all the ingredients needed to allow the Commission and Parliament to work together on defining the new common agricultural , food and environmental policies that we so urgently need . 
(RO) Madam President , we need a strong agricultural sector , guaranteed by a common agricultural policy , which will have a sufficient budget , capable of ensuring food security in Europe . 
I think that Europe ' s farmers are entitled to decent incomes , which , along with ensuring food security , provide a basic justification for preserving the CAP . 
However , greater fairness is needed in the distribution of direct payments , both among Member States and farmers . 
I hope that the future legislative proposal will provide a solution for getting rid of the unfair disparities . 
At the same time , I want to thank the Commission for its intention to introduce a simplified funding programme for small farms . 
Programmes for young farmers are also just as important . 
They must be given support in embarking on their farming career , not only as a contribution to rural development , but also to ensure a generational changeover , which is absolutely vital to the medium- and long-term future of European agriculture . 
(PL) Madam President , Commissioner , I believe that the Dess report has one very serious flaw . 
Paragraph 16 blatantly contradicts the fundamental principle of equal conditions for competition on the single market . 
On the one hand there is a proposal to move away from the historical reference values , and yet on the other hand there is a proposal to sanction huge differences in direct support for farmers from the individual Member States . 
Some would be given EUR 200-250 per hectare , others EUR 350 or over EUR 400 , and we are not just talking about a division into old and new Member States , since farmers from Portugal , Spain , the United Kingdom , Austria , Finland and Sweden would also receive the lower rates . 
It is high time to introduce equal conditions for competition in the agricultural sector , and any differences - which will be obvious - should result solely from objective criteria . 
(IT) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , everyone is aware of the importance of the common agricultural policy and of the contribution it has made to the development of the EU and to food security . 
Environmental challenges and the fight against climate change mean that the post-2013 CAP now has a new role to play , for which I believe we need a stronger and more sustainable CAP equipped with a budget that can meet the objectives to be pursued , with particular attention to the development of quality food products and to the needs of small farmers . 
Speculation in agricultural commodities and extreme price volatility put food security at risk and require flexible measures . 
Possible market fluctuations must be tackled with counter-cyclical measures , which should be included in the first pillar and be capable of responding swiftly and automatically . 
(PT) Madam President , this report does not address the future challenges mentioned in its title , but more importantly it does not address the serious problems of the present . 
That is why we have tabled a set of draft amendments that we consider essential for a thorough overhaul of the current common agricultural policy . 
I would like to highlight here the ones advocating market regulation measures and intervention mechanisms to guarantee farmers fair prices for their produce , and every country ' s right to produce . 
Among other examples , we propose keeping the system of milk production quotas as an essential condition for protecting producers in particularly sensitive countries; we advocate maintaining planting rights in the wine sector and maintaining aid for the distillation of potable alcohol and emergency distillation; and we propose setting up a public agricultural insurance scheme , financed from EU funds , to guarantee a minimum income for farmers in the event of natural disasters . 
We have tabled proposals for socially and environmentally sustainable agriculture , a vision that is incompatible with shameless declarations of faith in the market and competitiveness , like those made in this report . 
Madam President , my party favours withdrawal from the EU altogether , and therefore from the CAP . 
However , the reality is that we are in it and we have got to make the best of it . 
What do we think of the Dess report ? 
Well it is a bit like the legendary curate ' s egg . 
Parts of it are good . 
The idea of making direct payments conditional upon cross-compliance with environmental protection and landscape management is potentially beneficial , but only as long as they are not tied to the semi-religious precepts of climate change and social diversity nonsense . 
The report recognises that the agricultural sector must continue to be supported by government price intervention , because quantities produced cannot be predicted or planned precisely and demand for agricultural products is low in price elasticity . 
That is important to ensure food security and avoid price volatility . 
The most important thing from our point of view is that the UK must cease to be a net contributor to the cost of the CAP . 
(PT) Madam President , the long process of work that this important report required , including the many compromises reached , have made it a broad-based , well-balanced record of the various interests that the common agricultural policy (CAP) has to address . 
This report provides good guidance for legislative proposals , and I congratulate the rapporteur on that . 
There are , however , a few proposals that worry me , and I will make sure I follow their progress closely . 
I am referring to the redistribution of aid , which I think should be done strictly within the scope of the first pillar and on the basis of purely objective criteria , so that the aim of redistribution is not subverted by criteria of correctness , which will only tend to maintain the status quo . 
We need a fairer CAP with a large enough budget for what is asked of it . 
I must also mention the need to place the much-abused dairy sector on the CAP political agenda by adopting Amendments 16 , 12 and 5 . 
(PL) Madam President , the aim of the common agricultural policy is to guarantee continuity in the supply of food to Europe ' s citizens . 
We must supply safe and high-quality food at affordable prices . 
This is what consumers expect . 
We must care for the environment when producing and processing food . 
We say yes to the common agricultural policy , and no to its nationalisation . 
We say yes to a large budget , and no to cuts to the common agricultural policy . 
Direct payments should be paid according to a simple method and on an equal basis , to all farmers in all Member States . 
Let us not forget that direct payments account for only part of farmers ' income . 
Market regulations are therefore important . 
Good prices and market stability guarantee an income for farmers . 
We must ensure access to public services such as education , health services , transport services , sport and culture for citizens of rural areas . 
These are measures which should fall under the second pillar and cohesion policy . 
Commissioner , let us keep in place a programme which enables us to supply food to Europe ' s poorest citizens . 
(RO) Madam President , food security is one of the challenges of the future . 
The CAP must respond to this challenge . 
The new policy must continue with the positive features of the current policy and rectify the errors . 
I believe that this is what the Dess report does . 
Two pillars are being proposed: direct payments and rural development . 
Historical criteria are to be removed and objective criteria are required . 
There is no suggestion of an equal direct payment for all Member States . 
There is to be a fair difference , based on geographical and economic conditions , with a minimum and maximum limit in relation to the European average . 
The emphasis is on the environmental element , which is also being simplified . 
A strong rural development component is being retained and a request is being made for the amount of funding in the budget after 2014 to be at least equivalent to the 2013 level . 
I am pleased that Parliament ' s first report drafted after the Commission communication features very many guiding principles in common with the latter document . 
(ES) Madam President , the most important message issued by this House today is that it wants a fair common agricultural policy , or in other words a CAP that guarantees a sufficient level of income for all producers , irrespective of their activity and of the place where it is conducted . 
To achieve this , we need ambitious policies in the areas of direct payments , market management - including up-to-date intervention prices - and rural development , thus adapting the CAP to the new reality . 
Indeed , the new CAP must be adapted to the 2020 strategy , but this must not entail cuts of even EUR 1 , because there is no surfeit of resources for all the environmental , social and health challenges we intend to take on . 
I am particularly satisfied with Commissioner Cioloș ' s announcement that all possibilities will be explored also within the first pillar to draw young people into agriculture . 
Sometimes , quite rightly , we focus on improving conditions for current workers , but disregard in public debate what we need to do to bring new workers into agriculture so that our production will be assured and improved , in view of the fact that the countries that have lent most support to young farmers are least exposed to land abandonment . 
This challenge , which concerns the whole of Europe , is so serious that it should not by any means be left to the arbitrary determination of domestic policy . 
(FR) Mr President , a point of order: I would like to highlight the shocking attitude of the Hungarian Presidency , which is probably one of the worst that the EU has seen . 
The Presidency attended the first debate on the European Council , left at the start of the debate on the common agricultural policy and has just come back in for the debate on economic governance . 
This is an indication of how much it values European agriculture and European farmers . 
Yet the CAP makes up 40% of the budget: it should have been worth the Hungarian Presidency ' s while to stay for the discussion . 
I wanted to make that point . 
(IT) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we will vote in favour of this own-initiative report because the CAP is a fundamentally important tool for European agriculture and for the protection of EU producers and products as compared with non-European producers and products . 
The main points of the report , which is based on maintaining current funding levels , provide for new and reasonable criteria for allocating funding , since the historical criterion has been abandoned as the parameter for redistributing direct payments . 
Provision has been made for payments to farms , account has been taken of production output and costs , and payments have been simplified . 
The report calls for direct payments to be capped and to be restricted to active farmers , precisely so that the recipients are those who actually cultivate the land , not speculators . 
Another point that we consider significant relates to rural development and to the harnessing of all natural and human potential through quality agricultural production and the protection of mountain areas . 
One of the objectives of the new CAP must be to integrate new farmers , particularly young farmers , with targeted budget headings , and to reduce burdens and bureaucracy . 
(DE) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the Dess report represents a major step towards reform of the common agricultural policy . 
It is of fundamental importance that we find and deliver an efficient basis for the allocation of agricultural funding . 
This includes making allocations in the first pillar , in particular , fairer . 
I think it is high time to give up the historical approach . 
We have many discussions on how funds are distributed between the Member States , but we also need to discuss how they are allocated within Member States . 
There are major imbalances there , too . 
Less favoured areas , particularly mountain areas and small farms , need to be given special consideration . 
Where less favoured areas are concerned , Commissioner , 12 months ago this House delivered a report on the redefinition of these , in which we were highly critical . 
We have heard nothing more about this and I would be very interested to know the Commission ' s thinking in this respect . 
Mr President , after over an hour spent debating the report by Mr Dess , I remain very optimistic , not only about tomorrow ' s vote and the support for a report which , as I said in my introductory remarks , is very similar to the proposals contained in the Commission communication from the end of last year , but also about our future common agricultural policy . 
I would like to repeat what I said in my introduction: I remain committed to the principle of maintaining a balance and complementarity between the two pillars of the common agricultural policy . 
I also intend to keep a strong second pillar in the future common agricultural policy . 
Indeed , we have many aspirations for the second pillar: on territorial balance , environmental issues , young farmers , small farms , local markets and rural development . 
I can promise you that I , together with President Barroso and the Commission , see the second pillar as a priority . 
It will not be sacrificed in discussions on the future common agricultural policy budget . 
Let me reassure you on that point - and I speak for President Barroso too . 
Nor do I want the question of food , which remains the primary and essential purpose of the common agricultural policy , to be pitted against environmental concerns - and the Commission communication does not pit them against each other , in fact . 
What we are proposing is balanced support for a range of agricultural practices . 
This will ensure a balance between the aim of being financially competitive and the desire to maintain and conserve our natural resources ' regenerative capacities . 
In fact , I do not see how agriculture could be competitive in the medium and long term without careful management of natural resources . 
That is why we want to find a balance within the CAP , rather than pitting food concerns against environmental issues . 
Then there is the question of a more targeted common agricultural policy . 
Mr Ashworth raised this point , although I see that he is no longer here . 
The Commission is proposing more targeted direct payments . 
Here again , I consider that the proposals made in Mr Dess ' s report are very much in line with what the Commission plans to include in its legislative proposals . 
We will propose measures that will allow us to deal with crises , be they market crises , health crises or crises related to extreme weather . 
That is the kind of instruments that we will be proposing . 
I would also like to thank Parliament for supporting us in this key aim , which will provide reassurance to farmers in the future . 
Having made these additional comments , let me conclude by reiterating my confidence about tomorrow ' s vote and in the quality of the Dess report . 
I can promise you that in October , when the Commission presents its legislative proposals , you will recognise all the key elements . 
I would like to thank you once again for this work , which has brought real added value to the legislative package that the Commission will be tabling . 
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to thank everyone for this intense debate , and also for the support that I have been given here . 
Commissioner , we are all looking forward to your communication in October and then to good , positive cooperation . 
European agriculture is a positive factor . 
It feeds more than 500 million people , farms and looks after more than 170 million hectares of arable land and pasture , it provides many jobs in areas upstream and downstream , is an important buttress of rural areas and is already the most sustainable agricultural sector in the world . 
I therefore cannot understand why President Barroso has spoken of huge cuts in the second pillar . 
In so doing he is also jeopardising the EU2020 goals - in other words , his own goals . 
When 14 million farmers are feeding 500 million people , is it too much to ask that European agricultural policy be used to ensure that the 500 million people also provide properly for the 14 million farmers , so to speak ? 
Here I should like to emphasise - as has been mentioned a couple of times today already - that there have been departures from my original report on some matters . 
I have been in the political game too long , and I know exactly why I drafted the report as I did . 
Had I written the report as it stands today , what would I have had to offer in the compromise negotiations ? 
I allowed enough margin to ensure that everyone could be pacified , and a good result has been achieved today . 
My report therefore had a substantial buffer . 
The result I wanted to achieve was for us to send a signal as Parliament that we are addressing the important aspects that are necessary if European farmers are to have a good future . 
Once the legislative proposals are on the table , Commissioner , we will then work intensively to achieve a good outcome together . 
I can already assure you that you are likely to have greater support here in Parliament than some other commissioners would have . 
We are able to offer you that . 
The debate is closed . 
The vote will take place on Thursday 23 June 2011 . 
Written statements (Rule 149)
Agriculture provides security of supply of affordable , quality food; it provides essential protection for the environment and for balanced land use; and it creates jobs , growth and wealth . 
Giving money to farmers simply on the basis of the amount of land they own cannot be justified . 
We have successfully pushed to change subsidies , so that 80% of subsidies no longer benefit just 20% of the largest farmers , and in this way we have helped small farmers . 
We have paved the way for a common agricultural policy that is fairer to the countries of the European Union and to farmers and different kinds of production; that respects the specific conditions in our regions; that is environmentally friendly; and that promotes employment in rural areas . 
With regard to milk quotas , we have to check whether or not it is in fact a good idea to continue to implement a decision made eight years ago , on the basis of forecasts . 
This point is extremely important for the Azores in view of the fact that the sector plays a strategic role and quotas have been very important to milk producers until now . 
I must emphasise this , because alternatives to the milk quota scheme have not yet been put forward . 
We are all aware of the potential and crucial role the common agricultural policy has in achieving environmental and climate targets , in providing public goods and also in attaining the EU ' s food security targets . 
However , it is extremely important that , when we talk about agriculture and the future of the CAP , ' simplification ' and ' innovation ' are the watchwords . 
We must focus on those policy measures which do not impose new administrative burdens because we do not want to make our farmers ' lives even harder . 
The common agricultural policy must become fairer and simpler . 
I believe that we need to find a fair balance between the policy objectives we are proposing and the administrative burden . 
We need to safeguard farmers ' welfare and strengthen local economies . 
We have to protect the environment and also be concerned about producing high-quality , safe and healthy food . 
When it comes to agriculture , we must not focus exclusively on technological solutions or on discussions about technological solutions . 
We also have to take into account consumption patterns , the issue of waste and the complex relationship between the environment , biodiversity and health . 
in writing . - Firstly I wish to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work . 
The final document sends a clear message to the Commission , which is currently in the middle of its internal budget discussion on the next financial programme: namely that Parliament sees the future common agricultural policy as one that is capable of delivering for the European economy in terms of employment and growth . 
It is a policy that will deal with the challenges of food security; it is a policy that will deliver public goods , protect the environment and enhance biodiversity; and it is a vehicle for tackling climate change . 
Reducing European farmers ' capacity and hampering their competitiveness and viability with a weak CAP budget would be counterproductive and short-sighted . 
This is a sector with a wealth of potential for expansion , for growth in the economy , for research and innovation and for tackling climate change . 
The CAP produces measurable results and a clear return on investment with regard to the delivery of public goods . 
The CAP post-2014 , as outlined in this report , has clear aims and priorities , on which European farmers can and will deliver - but they need the support of a credible budget behind them . 
in writing . - (RO) I think that the report drafted by Mr Dess is vital in the context of the global food crisis and current environmental risks . 
The new version of the common agricultural policy includes values such as consumer protection and regional cohesion . 
I think that long-term productivity depends , to a large extent , on the sustainable management of natural resources , which is another objective on the agenda . 
I welcome the initiative promoting more active involvement by farmers in rural development programmes , which will help boost local competitiveness . 
Food security is another priority in the new common agricultural policy . 
Cooperation between Member States is essential , as demonstrated during the E . coli crisis this summer . 
In order to avoid food price fluctuations , I support the adoption of additional risk-prevention measures available to all EU farmers . 
At the same time , I think that it is important for agricultural funds to be distributed fairly . 
On this point , I should stress , for example , the impact of direct aid on boosting small farms ' profitability and competitiveness . 
Special payments must also be programmed for areas with natural handicaps which have special needs . 
in writing . - As a member of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety and a committed environmental campaigner , I expected a Dess report which would represent a CAP for the carbon era - one based upon environmental incentives , resource management , and a strong investment in the wider environmental issues facing the EU . 
As such , I am impressed by the degree to which the Dess report has committed to greening CAP; to supporting small- and medium-sized food producers; and to looking towards the future while also addressing the current concerns which face European agriculture . 
Given that the Commission is broadly in agreement with the Parliament ' s proposals , I call on this House to make their voice heard in ensuring that the European Council also supports this report ' s environmental proposals . 
in writing . - (RO) The common agricultural policy is faced with a number of challenges calling for the European Union and Member States to make a strategic decision about the future of agriculture . 
To be able to tackle these challenges effectively , the CAP must operate in an environment of sound economic policies and sustainable public funding which will help the Union achieve its EU 2020 strategy objectives . 
I think that the European Union also needs to have in the future adequate instruments for tackling the crises affecting the market and food supply , as well as the fluctuations in the prices and market in the agricultural sector . 
I think that CAP funds need to be shared fairly for the first and second pillars , both among Member States and among farmers within a Member State . 
This will tangibly reduce the great disparities in how these funds are shared among Member States . 
The CAP ' s second pillar is of paramount importance for rural development . 
I think that particular attention should be focused on motivating and encouraging young farmers . 
Consequently , I am in favour of introducing in this pillar targeted measures which will be defined by Member States , with the aim of achieving the EU ' s priority targets so that compensation payments are maintained for the disadvantaged areas in the second pillar . 
Agriculture is without a doubt the economic sector in which the European Union has achieved the most . 
The current debate takes place against the backdrop of the Commission ' s plans to unveil vital proposals for reform in October . 
This House has reached a compromise in the report under discussion . 
We have retained two strong pillars: the first pillar , direct aid , needs adequate funding that reflects the challenges facing agriculture , which means at least maintaining current financing levels . 
However , it will also be brought more into line with the second pillar , support for sustainable development . 
I believe that the greening of the first pillar needs to be judged correctly , so that it does not add to the environmental requirements with which farmers are already seriously burdened . 
After all , their primary role is to produce food . 
The report also reaches out to young farmers who , as we know , struggle to get started in the sector . 
However , clearly these objectives can only be achieved if the Union ' s budget is not cut . 
What is the point of having ambitious aims if we do not have the means to realise them ? 
We in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament have worked hard to ensure that the new EU agricultural policy is oriented towards ecological standards . 
In our view , farmers must be rewarded for providing services to society . 
That is exactly what they do , and nothing could be rewarded less in the prices currently being achieved at market . 
Retaining the two-pillar model guarantees that farmers will continue to receive a fixed amount in the future that they can rely on . 
These payments are important for long-term planning . 
By linking the direct payment to an economic variable we can achieve the transition from a Europe of 15 Member States to a Europe of 27 without offending anyone too much . 
The report is a good compromise; it is a European compromise . 
The question now is what the Commission , and particularly President Barroso , will make of it . 
Cutting the funding for environmental protection in particular suggests narrow-mindedness , and I hope Commissioner Cioloş will be able to talk him out of it . 
This report proposes the continuity of the common agricultural policy (CAP) , though with some contradictions . 
We therefore take a critical stance , and we have put forward alternative proposals that respond effectively both to the need for agricultural production to ensure food sovereignty and food security in every country , and to the problems of family farming and rural development . 
These proposals all take into account the social importance of the land and of the people who work it , the specific characteristics of each country and social justice in the distribution of grants , both among Member States and among crops and farmers . 
That is why we have put forward this set of proposals , in which in particular we clearly and unequivocally advocate the system of production quotas adapted to each Member State according to its food requirements , thus ensuring that farmers in countries such as Portugal are protected . 
We want to guarantee every country ' s right to produce , and we are against liberalisation of the dairy sector and of planting rights in the wine sector . 
We also want to maintain aid for the distillation of potable alcohol and emergency distillation beyond 2012 , and we uphold the ' existence of market regulation instruments and intervention mechanisms to ensure fair prices for production ' , thus countering the deregulating trend of previous CAP reforms . 
Europe will need a strong agriculture even after 2013 , because the principal means of guaranteeing European citizens ' food security is European agriculture . 
Food production has to remain the primary aim of agriculture , because the world population continues to grow and is predicted to reach 9 billion by 2045 . 
However , we need a strong common agricultural policy and strong agricultural assistance to achieve this goal . 
I therefore consider it important that pursuant to the report , the agricultural budget be maintained at least at the same level as in 2013 in the next EU financing period . 
This March , the Hungarian Presidency adopted presidential conclusions serving the interests of European farmers . 
The excessive price volatility in the previous period is partly the consequence of wrong decisions taken by the EU , for instance the abolition of maize intervention . 
Thus , we need an agricultural policy which ensures efficient action against extreme price volatility and speculation . 
The milk crisis made it clear that measures to restrict production are needed in the milk sector . 
In Member States where there was a higher-than-average decrease in sugar production as a result of the sugar reform , production must be allowed to increase . 
in writing . - It is imperative that the CAP is adequately equipped to rise to the challenges it will have to face in the future . 
The CAP cannot be monolithic; it should be implemented with flexibility and within the current economic and political context . 
A regulatory policy-based framework should be developed with long-term goals in mind . 
This would afford small farmers greater stability and would enable them to draw up investment plans over a broader time horizon without concern for the disruption that could be caused by short-term quick-fix policies and give them the support they need to safeguard their business . 
The agriculture sector ' s susceptibility to market instability and price volatility must be addressed and the CAP should guarantee a safety-mechanism and provision for effective risk prevention , which would give farmers a measure of income security in these economically trying times and serve to provide foresight of how global price volatility will affect developing countries . 
The global climatic challenges , the strain posed by demographic changes on food security , as well as the economic recession , should lead to the intensification of efforts to ensure sustainable growth , encourage and protect jobs . 
Dedicated innovation and research will support Europe ' s transition to becoming more environmentally and economically sustainable . 
in writing . - (FI) This report was a victory for the advocates of Finnish and European agriculture . 
Owing to our northern location , we in Finland are at a considerable natural disadvantage when it comes to growing crops , and so it is important that there are no changes to the amount of aid that we receive . 
Parliament ' s position is a strong message for the Commission , which is drafting its proposal for the reform of the common agricultural policy . 
Restrictions on current levels of national aid cannot be acceptable after this . 
Food security is and will remain the main challenge facing EU agriculture . 
It is not the only one , as is also highlighted in the OECD-FAO report ' Agricultural Outlook 2011-2020 ' . 
I think that we must focus particular attention on the demographic challenges affecting the countryside in particular . 
If we fail to handle the demographic changes and make rural areas more attractive to young farmers , we run the risk , within a certain period of time , of this situation becoming a real obstacle preventing stable , high-quality agricultural production . 
With this in mind , we need to offer young people new , attractive measures , consistent financial support and increased access to innovative services and infrastructures . 
In addition to all these measures , there is also a need for better coordination between the financial support allocated to rural development and the other regional policies and for the maintenance of CAP funding at a level ensuring that all the proposed tasks can be achieved . 
This will enable us to facilitate more active economic , social and cultural involvement from young people in European Union agriculture . 
Unfortunately the bold and innovative aims initially proposed by the rapporteur have not survived our discussions . 
In some cases they have been forced to give way to wishy-washy , colourless and insipid compromises . 
I can live with that , particularly when it comes to a fairer distribution of direct payments in Europe to guarantee the smooth operation of the internal market . 
However , I do regret our lack of courage on across-the-board greening of the common agricultural policy . 
Our farmers want to produce healthy food efficiently in order to provide food security for Europe ' s 500 million citizens . 
Eleven Member States , including Luxembourg , have signed a joint letter to Commissioner Cioloş expressing their opposition to the end of the system of planting rights for vineyards in 2015 . 
I am glad that the European Parliament has endorsed that proposal in Mr Dess ' s report . 
We do need to be careful however: our farmers must not end up working as underpaid landscape gardeners , leaving us dependent on imports of food and agricultural commodities from third countries , products subject to far less stringent requirements than those imposed on our farmers . 
I fully support this position . 
We expect to see it included in the Commissioner ' s legislative proposals . 
The European Parliament must stand up for a strong , fair and well-financed CAP . 
It is time for us to ensure that direct payments are distributed fairly among Member States , regions and sectors . 
We need to show European citizens that genuine European solidarity exists and not just pay lip service to it . 
Mr Dess ' s report marks a very small step , but it is in the right direction . 
I also welcome the measures proposed for maintaining territorial balance in the EU . 
I am pleased that support is expressed in the report for young people in the agricultural sector because we must combat depopulation of rural areas . 
It is important that we maintain support for disadvantaged regions and the opportunity for production-related payments in the regions where there is no alternative to a particular production type . 
I am pleased to note that my request for greater flexibility within the second pillar was also heeded . 
The situation in agricultural sectors differs in the various Member States . 
Greater freedom in defining countries ' priorities will offer genuine opportunities for agricultural regions to develop . 
However , it is important for us to take care that the proposed measures do not introduce further red tape for agricultural producers . 
Let us send a strong signal to the European Commission and Europe ' s agricultural producers , showing our support for a fairer , simpler and more flexible CAP . 
in writing . - (DE) A healthy farming sector - and I am not talking here about agro-industrial factories , but rather about small-scale family farms - provides a guarantee of the continued existence of rural culture , nature and our cultural landscape , as well as being essential to securing the supply of food for our population . 
Just how important the latter is has been made clear to us once again by the recent enterohaemorrhagic E . coli (EHEC) crisis . 
Consumers make great demands of organic produce . 
They expect organic produce to provide ecological balance , which in reality is often more than questionable . 
Rather than having an especially positive impact on sustainability , the prudent use of resources , CO2 savings and the protection of livestock , organic produce is often transported right across Europe . 
The EU needs to act here - and I speak as a representative of Austria , the leading country in organic farming . 
Greater importance must be attached to regional provision and seasonal availability , as well as strict labelling of the origin of foods . 
Services provided by agriculture must therefore be recompensed by fair product prices . 
Let us not use the common agricultural policy to promote agro-industry; let us promote our farmers instead . 
in writing . - (FI) The reform of the EU ' s common agricultural policy is one of this Parliament ' s most important tasks . 
The report by Mr Dess is a good basis for continuing the reform . 
We need a broader debate , however , to achieve the objective of environmentally friendly , resource-effective and diverse agriculture . 
The answer to the global problems of agriculture will not be found by increasing production in Europe , but is part of a broader equation , in which economic , social and environmental issues are taken into account . 
Instead of a narrow-minded agricultural policy , we need a food policy that considers the whole food production chain , from start to finish . 
That is the best way that we can respond to the serious , all-encompassing challenges faced by agriculture in its present form in the 2000s . 
I am delighted to learn that the new common agricultural policy will end the period of discrimination against farmers in certain Member States , including my own . 
I would like to thank the rapporteur for his work , which is clearly the work of an author who understands the issues involved . 
I am all the more alarmed by the attempt to establish new discriminatory conditions . 
The capping of direct payments is a new form of discrimination against Member States in which , for historical reasons , most of the agricultural undertakings manage larger areas of land . 
These agricultural undertakings comply with the same rules and provide the same services as small undertakings in other countries , and they fulfil the conditions for direct payments equally well . 
The discrimination against large undertakings resulting from capping may put jobs in rural areas at risk , and stifle innovative potential . 
If we want to talk credibly about a single market , can we really countenance discrimination against certain Member States in the form of differences in payments per hectare or capping ? 
Farmers from the 12 new Member States have now reached the end of a difficult 10-year period , which they agreed to on the understanding that it was a transitional period which would not be extended . 
Let us not prolong these inequalities contrary to the spirit of the EU accession negotiations , and let us not damage the credibility of the EU in the eyes of some of its citizens . 
We are gambling with the future of the EU itself . 
I would therefore like to call on all fellow Members to support Amendments 10 and 11 , which reject the capping of payments . 
A fundamental requirement for fair competition on the internal market is the establishment of fair and transparent conditions for all farmers throughout the EU . 
The report on the future of the common agricultural policy (CAP) is heading in this direction . 
Many of the negotiated compromises should be welcomed unequivocally , for example the simplification of administrative procedures in various areas of the CAP , or the continuation of full funding for direct payments in the EU budget and the refusal to renationalise these . 
However , I regard the issue of European farmers getting preferential treatment or being put at a disadvantage on the basis of additional criteria , for example the size of holdings , as problematic in view of the historically determined nature of the situation in the individual Member States . 
I wish to express my satisfaction with this first text on the future of the CAP . 
Even at this early stage , it aims to send the Commission what is a positive message for our farmers , pending receipt of the legislative text . 
Indeed , I consider that many paragraphs contain information that I and some of my colleagues sought to include . 
I refer to the important statements that promote our southern agriculture . 
For example , direct aid will no longer simply be based on a premium per hectare , but the size of the farm , employment arrangements , labour productivity and legal form will also be taken into consideration at long last . 
I am also very pleased that these payments will only be awarded to farmers who are truly active in the sector , so that the aid goes to those who genuinely need it and who use it to benefit agriculture . 
Provision has also been made to distribute aid more evenly , bearing in mind that , for historical reasons , farms in the European Union have very diverse structures . 
I fully support the paragraph calling for the new CAP to be equipped with the instruments necessary to limit price volatility . 
I will conclude by mentioning the most common form of agricultural production in my region , olive oil production , and the measure that we are awaiting from the Commission: an updated private storage system and the introduction of private storage . 
With food security being a key factor in globalisation nowadays , we need to maintain our capacity for being self-sufficient . 
This means maintaining an ambitious common agricultural policy that can satisfy our most basic long-term need: food . 
The CAP does , however , need to be tweaked to make it fairer . 
European citizens would not understand if the bulk of assistance were to go to large agricultural operators: small farmers too must be able to make a living from what they produce , work in decent conditions and be paid fairly . 
When allocating aid , we must also give more thought to natural constraints , such as global warming , mountain areas and scarce water supplies . 
The current drought demonstrates that the CAP urgently needs to include practical resources that will allow our farmers to deal with water shortages . 
I would therefore appeal for a subtle shift in the CAP to make it more relevant and able to guarantee our food self-sufficiency , the vitality of our agricultural sector and the preservation of our rural areas . 
Prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances - Implementation of excessive deficit procedure - Requirements for budgetary frameworks of Member States - Budgetary surveillance in euro area - Surveillance of budgetary positions and surveillance and coordination of economic policies - Enforcement measures to correct excessive macroeconomic imbalances in euro area (debate)
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
by Mrs Ferreira , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances _ - _ C7-0301 / 2010 -
by Mr Feio , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1467 / 97 on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure -
by Mrs Ford , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the proposal for a Council directive on requirements for budgetary frameworks of the Member States - 2010 / 0277(NLE)]
by Mrs Goulard , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the effective enforcement of budgetary surveillance in the euro area - C7-0298 / 2010 -
by Mrs Wortmann-Kool , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 1466 / 97 on the strengthening of the surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance and coordination of economic policies - C7-0300 / 2010 - , and
by Mr Haglund , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on enforcement measures to correct excessive macroeconomic imbalances in the euro area - C7-0299 / 2010 - . 
Mr President , in the view of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament , the component of the economic governance package that deals with the Stability and Growth Pact is not the response that Europe requires at this time of structural crisis . 
The package does indeed revisit the Stability and Growth Pact , but not to change its essence . 
It revisits it to make its demands broader and its penalties tougher . 
It would seem more useful to assume that the pact is impossible to comply with if a country ' s economy is not growing and , in particular , if there is a crisis . 
These issues should be at the heart of the political agenda . 
We should discuss having a crisis management policy and its associated instruments in euro area countries and , on another matter , how to prevent the persistently divergent evolution of the euro economies from destroying the single currency . 
If these issues are not resolved , the pact becomes stupid , as someone said . 
There is , however , a glimmer of hope in the package: the new initiative to identify and correct the macroeconomic imbalances that build up , particularly in the eurozone , before they become insoluble problems . 
Parliament wanted responsibilities as co-legislator and has carried them out to the full . 
The text on which we are going to vote reflects a broad consensus , which was only possible thanks to everyone ' s huge capacity for work and spirit of compromise . 
As rapporteur , I wish to thank all my fellow Members from all political groups , particularly my shadow rapporteurs , and I pick out Mr Haglund especially , for whom I acted as shadow rapporteur as well . 
The trialogue phase was long and hard , and the agreement we reached - sadly not a full one - was due to the Hungarian Presidency , represented by Minister Kármán , the Commission , represented by Commissioner Rehn , and all our partners . 
Let us speak plainly: identifying macroeconomic imbalances is a complex and completely novel process . 
Rather than merely applying sanctions , it is important to identify the risks competently , find out whether they are the country ' s responsibility or whether they result from external impacts , and make correct , timely and practicable recommendations . 
After the negotiating process , the scoreboard - that is , the set of indicators that have been negotiated - includes not only financial and nominal indicators , but also indicators from the real economy . 
We also trust that the Commission will scrupulously respect the compromise of recital 6-A , which involves Parliament alongside the Council in future review processes . 
Interpretation will also not be done automatically , but intelligently through in-depth reviews , which are demanding for the Commission but necessary . 
The Commission ' s recommendations will have to ensure consistency with all the other strategic documents , but the country will bear the main responsibility for proposing solutions to implement . 
Parliament ' s enhanced powers , the greater involvement of the social partners and respect for collective bargaining practices have all been guaranteed . 
Penalties are justified in cases of lack of cooperation but not where countries are unable to meet the targets . 
They are also graded , which is an important aspect . 
We would have preferred to lighten the penalties , but we had to agree to them as part of the compromises . 
Before agreement can be reached , there is one fundamental stumbling block: the recognition that in an internal market , in a monetary area , it makes sense that the variations in the scoreboard indicators should be observed whether they are positive or negative , and that both deficits and surpluses should be subject to observation , even though they obviously do not give rise to similar recommendations . 
All of us - individual Members , political groups and institutions - have come a long way . 
Agreement on a balanced , high-quality text is in sight . 
I just hope that the spirit of compromise that has brought us this far will carry us through to a final agreement . 
Mr President , this is a further stage in an exceptional piece of work that we have been doing in the European Parliament . 
At this point I must warmly acknowledge Mrs Wortmann-Kool , Mrs Goulard , Mr Haglund , Mrs Ferreira and Mrs Ford , who have been rapporteurs with me throughout this economic governance package . 
I must also offer a very special word of thanks to the various shadow rapporteurs who have helped us in our work . 
Lastly , I must emphasise the exceptional work carried out by the Council on this issue , especially by András Kármán , who worked closely with us , and Commissioner Rehn , who also played an invaluable part in the whole process . 
My first word is one of confidence , in a positive vein . 
This economic governance package must show that Europe is capable: it is capable of overcoming difficulties and it is capable of guarding against future problems . 
That is why I am highly confident about what is going to happen with this economic governance legislation in the coming days . 
In the Stability and Growth Pact , for which I was rapporteur for the corrective part , it is possible to add the idea of growth to that of stability and budgetary discipline . 
It is possible to innovate with the macroeconomic imbalance procedure . 
It is possible to go beyond an approach of merely having a penalty mechanism , and that is why adoption of this economic governance package will lead to more Europe and better Europe . 
In relation to the corrective part of the Stability and Growth Pact , for example , this economic governance package has brought us a more intelligent application of the pact , through the attention it devotes to the debt criterion; the introduction of an average rate for debt reduction , to be carried out over three years , allowing for flexibility in fulfilling the rules; a more detailed and appropriate list of relevant factors that the Commission should take into account in its assessment of the financial situation of the countries involved; and the introduction of a three-year transition period for implementation of the debt criterion . 
There are also other aspects that I want to highlight here , which concern other reports . 
Because we worked in conjunction all the time , I must mention the important introduction of a European semester regime in the preventive part , and point out that the preventive part is essential and that penalties should only be applied as the final step in this whole procedure . 
The procedure includes the introduction of symmetry in the analysis of macroeconomic indicators , the possibility that the Commission will produce a study on Eurobonds by the end of this year , an integrated vision of penalties as a final step in relation both to macroeconomic imbalances and to the Stability and Growth Pact , and the question of introducing reverse qualified majority voting for Council decisions . 
All these steps have been taken as essential parts of Parliament ' s role . 
That is why we can send our citizens a very clear message right now . 
The message is that we are preparing an institutional mechanism to prevent future crises . 
Europe will be much better prepared with this economic governance package . 
Europe is taking a crucial step with this economic governance package so that our economy can grow soundly . 
rapporteur . - Mr President , I would like to start by thanking the European Council . 
We can all see the incredibly sensitive situation in Europe and especially in the eurozone which has required different countries to work together in a way that has never been seen before . 
We can see the vital need to improve competitiveness and rebuild public finances in a sustainable manner . 
Over recent days , weeks and months , we have constantly seen ministers from Member States coming together to try to help find ways out of each other ' s individual problems . 
In addition , never before have I seen such a desire from members of the public to understand where public money is spent . 
So let me first talk about the directive that I have worked on . 
The directive sets out a series of requirements in accounting statistics , forecasting and budgetary processes . 
Let us not forget that inadequate budget planning and inaccurate information compounded this crisis . 
It is a Council directive , not a co-legislative report , and the Council has debated this extensively . 
Member States themselves have agreed that they will adopt fiscal planning horizons of at least three years to include all levels of government and government funds in their budget processes and ensure that information on , for example , contingent liabilities is disclosed . 
Accounting and forecasting performance will be independently evaluated . 
Let me say that many of the Member States already comply with large parts of this directive , but implementing this minimum series of requirements will introduce discipline and restore confidence , and is a first small step back on the path to stability in public finances . 
In addition , Member States themselves have agreed that they will each introduce their own legislation on fiscal rules - not necessarily German constitution debt breaks - but rules tailor-made in each country to keep them in line with their obligations under the Treaty . 
Now this is sensitive as well because different countries have different obligations under the Treaty and for that reason that section does not apply to the UK . 
During the negotiations on the wider ' six pack ' a number of suggestions for improving this Council directive were made , many by the European Central Bank and by Members of this House . 
The Council has worked in good faith to try and improve the directive where appropriate and improve transparency , but without stepping on the sensitive issues relating to individual national constitutions . 
Briefly on the other directives . 
Through these negotiations I have tried to be constructive in allowing euro zone Member States in particular to set up what rules and sanctions they see necessary to underpin their stability . 
I have not supported colleagues who think the solution is just a stronger role for the European Parliament . 
Over the weekend and on Monday night , the Council tried to offer a final compromise on an outstanding issue of votes in the European Council . 
Whilst this is not , in my opinion , a deeply significant issue in my own Member State - as we do not intend to join the euro and resulting fines do not apply to us - it is an extremely difficult and contentious issue in many countries , including those who intend to join . 
This is a time to try to understand each other ' s problems but also respect each other ' s differences . 
Earlier this week I warned colleagues that heading into a direct confrontation between Parliament and the Council on an issue that I did not believe I could explain to any man on the street would not be a responsible position of this Parliament . 
Indeed , I said I thought it would be irresponsible . 
And this Parliament ' s approach on that issue is not supported by many of my group ' s members . 
I cannot support Parliament ' s changes to the Council text on the macroeconomic imbalances and I would like to see in the weeks ahead more clarity on the different positions between euro zone and non-euro-zone Member States . 
Mr President , we have had countless trialogue meetings , some late at night , with other Members , the Commission and the Hungarian Presidency . 
I would like to begin by thanking my fellow Members and our counterparts for the work that we have completed together . 
The message from the Ecofin Council is that everyone needs to shoulder their responsibilities . 
My immediate reaction is to say: ' All right , then , let us genuinely face up to our responsibilities . ' 
Not with a huge fanfare , not so as to be able to say that we reached an agreement rapidly , but with an eye on the financial problems in the euro area and the European Union and in an attempt to come up with some proper solutions . 
Certainly , that was my group ' s motto in these negotiations . 
I doubt that the markets and our citizens would believe in speedy but superficial solutions . 
In our estimation , substantial improvements are needed . 
We have , I think , already achieved some of the objectives that we set ourselves . 
Let me remind you that we are not the only ones with these aims: on several occasions , the European Central Bank has called on Parliament to beef up the Commission ' s already bold proposals . 
We have therefore firmed up the rules . 
That was one of our guiding principles: not for the pleasure of rule-making , but because breaking common rules in a community based on the rule of law endangers the single currency . 
We have introduced penalties for fraud . 
Unfortunately this is one of the lessons that we have had to learn from the euro ' s early years . 
As Mrs Ford said , we have also tried to impose a degree of order on national budgetary procedures , if only so as to be able to compare practices in different countries . 
One point was particularly important to me: if we go to our citizens with nothing to say other than ' we have increased automaticity ' , as the newspapers are putting it , they will be left with the impression that some mysterious machine has been turned on in Brussels and will rap them on the knuckles whenever something goes wrong . 
If we want stricter rules , they need to be more intelligent , but above all we need more democratic debate and more cross-border discussions . 
This is why we have proposed - and I would like to thank all the Members who have supported me on this point - creating what we have termed an economic dialogue , which must be proportionate . 
There is no threat to national constitutions; it is simply an expression of our desire for more discussion within the euro area in particular , but also in the Europe of 27 . 
We want this House to be the forum for that transparent dialogue between the European institutions and the Member States , and in particular a place where Member States can voice their problems and explain their positions . 
Some countries are lagging behind , others are further ahead , some are on the fringes , some have larger populations: we need to bear all that in mind . 
I am delighted to see that this week in the German media Mr Habermas has again stressed that increasing democratic legitimacy is a vital necessity . 
I would say to Mrs Ford that we are not arguing in favour of enhancing our powers , we are calling for a greater role for those mandated by the people to defend their interests in Brussels . 
There are other important points , particularly on the macroeconomic side . 
I believe that all Member States need to be subject to common surveillance . 
Symmetry is an important issue . 
The Council should understand what this means: intelligent symmetry that distinguishes between deficit and surplus , but symmetry all the same . 
Let me close by mentioning Eurosecurities , which were one of the things that I championed . 
I would like to make an appeal to all political group leaders: you cannot claim to support Eurosecurities but vote against them . 
You might argue that you want more , I myself would have liked to go further , but I do fully appreciate the efforts that Commissioner Rehn is willing to make . 
Let me remind you that the Commissioner himself put forward proposals in May 2010 in accordance with the Commission ' s legislative initiative . 
We want to put those proposals back on track . 
We want the euro finally to take on the mantle of a world currency , we want a large and liquid market , which will reduce the cost of borrowing . 
We want part of that borrowing - a limited amount , of course - to be shared in the long term using a full-blown market regulatory instrument . 
Consequently , I hope that tomorrow ' s vote will be favourable and that all those who claim to be in favour of Eurosecurities will discuss the issue in a spirit of open-mindedness rather than based on ideological prejudices . 
rapporteur . - (NL) Mr President , if one thing is clear , it is that Europe needs a solid foundation in order to prevent a new euro crisis in the future and to ensure sustainable economic growth . 
Our group , the Group of the European People ' s Party (Christian Democrats) , is satisfied with the results we have achieved so far in the legislative package on economic governance . 
I would like to extend my warm thanks to all the Members , rapporteurs , shadow rapporteurs , employees , staff and everyone for the many hours we have spent together in order to achieve this because , in exercising its powers , the European Parliament has taken a firm and ambitious position . 
I would like to thank the Hungarian Presidency , and in particular András Kámán , for the efforts put in to bridging the differences between the Council and Parliament . 
Indeed , you personally have made it possible for us to reach a 98% agreement , partly thanks to the helpful support of Commissioner Rehn and his staff . 
This is an excellent result , but it was not an easy one to achieve . 
Tomorrow , we will be voting on the reports . 
My group is strongly committed to building on the high level of agreement that we have reached . 
I hope that we will be able to bridge the last differences over the next few weeks so that we can finalise an agreement before the summer . 
This is very important , because my group is striving for a final vote in the plenary in July . 
The turmoil in the financial markets continues and we urgently need to find a solution to the debt crisis in several countries . 
However , it is just as urgent - and therein now lies our task as co-legislator - that Europe demonstrates strong decision making in terms of an ambitious stability pact and economic governance . 
Reaching a decision before the summer is crucial to restoring confidence in the euro , given that the Stability and Growth Pact was being broken as early as 2003 . 
Instead of the rules being enforced , they were simply liberalised and we now need to put a stop to that . 
This is about credible legislation , not behind-the-scenes negotiations between Member States aimed at avoiding penalties . 
If Member States fail to take effective action in order to meet their commitments and reduce their deficits - and these are commitments , remember , that they have undertaken of their own free will - then decision-making must be effective . 
That is why this House has proposed the reverse voting procedure . 
Let us face it , the magic formula of our fellow Members on the left , the golden rule , will not deliver the solution . 
Unfortunately , money does not grow on trees and the days of easy solutions and painless choices are now behind us . 
That is why the PPE Group is calling for sustainable public finances and for 5 or 6% budget deficits not to be permitted . 
A debt burden - the painful evidence of which we are witnessing - stands in the way of economic growth , not only in our European countries , but also in the United States . 
We need a solid foundation , and that is why I am pleased that the Council will exercise the preventive arm of the proposals , namely to ensure that Member States strengthen their own national responsibilities and involve their national parliaments in the process , clear deadlines , procedures and inspection visits , more public reports , peer pressure and public debates in this House rather than in the confines of the Council . 
Obviously , the European semester is an important achievement , because we want jobs and growth . 
We are facing an important and historic day . 
Tomorrow , in the House , we will stand ready to shoulder our responsibilities . 
I see that the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance want to put a spanner in the works . 
It seems that they only want to work in a spirit of compromise when it comes to their own reports . 
Mr President , that is no spirit of compromise . 
I would like to call on all Members who consider sustainable public finances important to support these six reports tomorrow . 
They are not the final outcome , because tomorrow we will be taking a step towards consulting with the Council on how we can clear these last hurdles on our way to - what will hopefully be - an agreement in July . 
Mr President , I believe that the events that we have been able to follow this week , both in the Council and in those countries that are wrestling with very serious economic problems , once again show us why the package we are now debating is so important . 
If we do not manage to make headway on these matters , the problems are more likely to continue rather than be resolved . 
I also believe that it is important to remember what happened in 2005 when we ought to have taken action and demonstrated that it is not all right to contravene the common allocation clauses . 
We did not do that; instead we changed the rules . 
Now it is time to rectify this . 
This package is important . 
I would like to say a big thank you to my fellow Members . 
We worked hard together . 
As has been said many times , we are very close to achieving the goal , but at the same time it is important that we are successful in the voting today and in July . 
I would also like to thank Mr Kármán from the Hungarian Presidency , who has done a splendid job . 
We really appreciate what he has done . 
As I said , I would also like to thank my fellow Members , and Mrs Ferreira in particular . 
We have done an excellent job in creating a macroeconomic surveillance procedure , which is something new and which complements the work that is done to keep the common currency afloat . 
That is something that Europe needs . 
Going back to 2005 , the European Parliament is still demanding that we find a solution with regard to what we refer to as reversed qualified majority voting . 
Why is that ? 
It is because we have found that if we do not have an adequate automatic decision-making system in the Council , the necessary decisions do not get taken . 
We cannot afford for this to happen any longer . 
In this regard , we still have an unresolved issue , but I hope that the Council will manage to hold a serious discussion on what this is actually about . 
The European Council is meeting on Thursday and Friday . 
It must not be the case that , for reasons of prestige , no decision is taken on something that everyone knows is necessary . 
Nor must it be the case that certain larger Member States think that they can agree in advance on certain matters , so making it a ' done deal ' . 
The Council must take genuine decisions and the legislation must be decided on in consultation with the European Parliament . 
The Council now has the opportunity to take wise decisions , and I am sure that the European Parliament can help it to take the right ones . 
With regard to the macroeconomic element , I would firstly like to emphasise that , thanks to the work that we have done in Parliament , we have a proposal that we have agreed on with the Council and one that is sufficiently transparent and also contains a solution that is sufficiently automatic . 
I believe that this solution means that we will also be able to feel secure in future with regard to the euro area and to the possibility of remedying the sorts of economic problems in an individual country that could otherwise result in the whole of the euro area being put at risk . 
I think it is good that , in our report , we establish a system for dealing with countries that fail to fulfil their commitments , in other words a requirement for the problems to be remedied directly . 
The first time a promise is broken , the country will be forced to pay an interest-bearing deposit , as we have called it . 
This is necessary . 
We cannot send out a signal to the effect that if a country promises to do something in particular , but then fails to do it there will be no consequences . 
Unfortunately , that is what the original proposal was like . 
I am pleased that we were able to rectify that . 
This is an important matter of principle . 
At the same time , we have also got to grips with the problem of fraud , where other countries are deceived . 
This is also extremely important . 
I think that the European Parliament has done a good job in this regard . 
As several speakers have said , tomorrow ' s vote is a very important one , and I believe that it will go well . 
I hope that , at the end of this week and through the following week , the European Council will be able to have a serious discussion about what we can do to reach an agreement . 
That is something that we will also do in Parliament . 
Then we can have the legislation that Europe so badly needs . 
That is crucial if we are going to be able to continue to have a common currency . 
President-in-Office of the Council . - Mr President , before I go into the substance , I would like to express my sincere appreciation to the Chair of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , the rapporteurs , the shadow rapporteurs and all representatives of the political groups who actively participated in the process for all their valuable contributions . 
I am equally thankful to the Commission , and the Commissioner himself , for their efforts to facilitate discussions , not only during the trilogues here in Parliament but within the Council too . 
The six legislative texts on economic governance have been the number one priority of the Hungarian Presidency . 
I must emphasise that it was not the individual decision of the Presidency to designate this file as the top priority . 
The Commission ' s initiative has also been supported by the Heads of State and Government of the 27 Member States . 
If we want to build a stronger euro , this governance package is an essential building block in that process . 
The world economy , including Europe , has experienced the worst crisis since the Great Depression and we have had to draw the necessary conclusions . 
We have to realise that the shock would have long-lasting effects unless we eliminate the core roots of the crisis . 
Many of the lessons to be learned are addressed by the six legislative proposals put forward by the Commission last September . 
More emphasis will be put on prevention in order to avoid the need for harmful procyclical policies in bad economic times . 
So far the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) has concentrated on deficit but this has not prevented the accumulation of high debt , so from now on more attention will be paid to the debt criteria . 
The lesson was learned that procedures have not been stringent and automatic enough . 
That is why we are also addressing these questions here , in order to strengthen the credibility of the Pact . 
We have also realised that coordination of fiscal policies through the SGP might not be sufficient in a Union sharing a single currency so we have agreed to introduce a new mechanism to tackle macroeconomic imbalances , which will be treated on the same footing as fiscal imbalances . 
In order to better and more deeply reflect the requirements of the Treaty in national procedures of Member States , we are about to adopt rules improving the quality of national budgetary frameworks . 
I am confident that the objectives of both Parliament and the Council are the same , namely to strengthen the economic governance of the EU and the euro area , prevent future crises and build a stronger framework for economic governance in the euro area and the EU as a whole . 
After an intensive round of trilogues with the rapporteurs and discussions at the Council , the Council modified its general approach on Monday . 
The result of this process was communicated to the European Parliament by a letter sent the next day , 21 June . 
I share the view that during the trilogues the quality of the text has improved a lot , and that the package has become stronger and more coherent . 
This is especially the case in terms of increased transparency and accountability and the more stringent and automatic application of the procedures . 
Firstly , let me mention the major elements as regards increased transparency and accountability . 
We are to describe the European semester in the legal text including the ample involvement of Parliament in the process . 
We have added provisions specifying the process of economic dialogue among European institutions including the European Parliament , the Council and individual Member States . 
The European Parliament would be involved on the same footing as the Council in the setting up and functioning of the scoreboard of indicators for an alert mechanism in the prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances . 
Regarding the governance cycle and the surveillance procedure , we fully respect the very important role of relevant national stakeholders , including social partners . 
Secondly , turning to the issue relating to a more stringent and automatic application of the procedures , let me mention the following: an additional sanction , an interest-bearing deposit for Member States in the excessive imbalance procedure , would be introduced . 
This has been a missing link in the procedures and it completes the procedure in a very logical way , similar to that provided for in the budgetary surveillance . 
An additional fine for Member States falsifying their fiscal statistics is also provided for , at the initiative of the Parliament . 
The application of reverse qualified majority voting is expanded to the recommendation on prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances . 
Moreover , in the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact , we make provision for a review of the expansion of reverse qualified majority voting . 
At the same time , the already existing comply-or-explain procedure would be enhanced . 
In deciding on the staff in the SGP , the Council is expected , as a rule , to follow the recommendations and proposals of the Commission or to explain its position publicly . 
The Presidency believes that the compromise reached during the trilogues reflects a good , balanced and comprehensive approach . 
We think that all parties have a strong interest in reaching a swift agreement . 
I regret that the proposal put forward to the plenary is different from the compromise we arrived at after a series of negotiation rounds and does not take into account the final compromise offer of the Council . 
At the same time , I am grateful for your wise approach that the Parliament still leaves open the possibility to have a first reading agreement shortly . 
It is high time that Europe joined forces and the Union is ready to live up to expectations . 
All the markets and investors are vigilant and would like to see whether we can deliver or not . 
The swift and timely adoption of the package is a must for all of us . 
Vice-President of the Commission . - President , honourable Members , let me first thank the Chair of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs Sharon Bowles , rapporteurs Corien Wortmann-Kool , Elisa Ferreira , Vicky Ford , Sylvie Goulard , Diogo Feio and Carl Haglund , as well as the shadow rapporteurs who all played a major part in the negotiations . 
The Chair , the rapporteurs and the shadow rapporteurs have all represented this House with great distinction . 
I also highly appreciate the outstanding role played by State Secretary András Kármán , who represented the Hungarian Presidency with such skill and determination . 
And I dare to say that I am very proud of my team in the Commission and I will thank them once we have reached the destination , with your help of course . 
I warmly welcome the texts that you have finalised . 
In the course of the trilogues , Parliament ' s negotiators have improved the Commission ' s proposals in many important respects . 
And you have gained a good many important improvements from the Council . 
The Commission supports the texts which you are about to vote on , and we can welcome and agree on all of your amendments . 
As we know , the Council agrees with almost all of them . 
But it did so with some exceptions which present quite a challenge - let me come back to that in a moment . 
There is no time to set out all the gains made by Parliament in these negotiations: my staff have made me a summary list of no less than 50 major improvements won by you . 
For instance , you have codified the European Semester , you have set up a structured economic dialogue , providing for a prominent role for Parliament throughout the European Semester . 
You have achieved the opportunity for detailed discussion of country-specific situations at every key decision-making stage of the policy cycle , including confirmation of Parliament ' s right to initiate dialogue with individual Member States . 
In all parts of the legislation you have won a better information flow to Parliament and more transparency . 
You have got a commitment from the Commission to do a study on euro securities within six months of the entry into force of this legislation . 
This will be accompanied by a Commission declaration , the text of which you have seen , setting out the scope for that report . 
I will come back to that as well . 
The Commission will also commit itself in this declaration to reviewing the intergovernmental nature of the European Stabilisation Mechanism by mid-2014 . 
You have got reverse qualified majority voting in a number of important cases - to improve the automaticity of decision-making - as the rule in the corrective arm of the Pact , where 24 Member States out of 27 now find themselves unfortunately . 
You have also won an equal role for Parliament in determining the scoreboard for detecting possible macroeconomic imbalances , and you have inserted firm guarantees on social dialogue , respect for national traditions on collective agreements , wage formation , and the role of social partners , which we fully share . 
There are going to be tough fines for statistical fraud and guarantees of independence for national statistical authorities . 
You have introduced earlier sanctions in the excessive imbalances procedure . 
I could go on and on . 
In your first legislative encounter with Ecofin as a co-legislator in economic policy , you achieved almost all of your most important objectives . 
This is a very good result for Parliament and for Europe . 
On euro securities , in the context of this package I will only confirm what I said at the trilogue on 15 June . 
The Commission intends to present a report to Parliament and the Council on the setting up of a system of common issuance of European sovereign bonds , or euro securities , under joint and several liability , in line with Article 8a(5) of the regulation on the enforcement of budgetary surveillance in the euro area and within six months of the entry into force of that Regulation . 
These euro securities would aim to strengthen fiscal discipline and increase stability through markets as well as , by taking advantage of the increase in liquidity , ensuring that the Member States enjoying the highest credit standards would not suffer from higher interest rates . 
The report will , if appropriate , be accompanied by legislative proposals . 
In other words , in our view such a report on euro securities goes hand in glove with and only makes sense with the prospective reinforcement of economic governance in line with this package now under deliberation . 
Let me say a few words on the next steps . 
I am worried . 
Should the package not be agreed , neither the Council nor Parliament should think that they can successfully shift the responsibility onto the other . 
That will not work . 
People watching the decision-making from outside are not interested in the smallest detail . 
If we fail - and I say we and I really mean us all - they will simply say that ' Europe ' has failed . 
Europe would fail and people ' s trust in the capacity of Europe to address their real problems would suffer a huge blow . 
Moreover , neither institution should imagine even for a moment that - whether for tactical or substantive reasons - they might get a better deal in the second reading . 
The Presidency has very skilfully extracted compromises from the Council that would most likely not appear on the table again if a first reading agreement could not be achieved . 
Actually only one issue remains open: the scope of reverse qualified majority voting . 
I believe you are all aware of the efforts we have made . 
The Commission supports reverse qualified majority voting . 
So does the ECB and a number of Member States , but not all of them and not in all places . 
The Council has already agreed to reverse qualified majority voting in five out of six decisions where it is legally possible . 
On the remaining one , there is a disagreement between Parliament and the Council . 
I believe a solution can and must be found . 
Therefore I appeal to you to seek a constructive solution on the remaining point in the next few days and I appeal to the Council too , to respond with a constructive approach on their part . 
I can reassure you that the Commission will work until the last minute , the last second , to find a satisfactory solution . 
Reinforced economic governance in Europe is simply too important to fail on this final remaining issue . 
Let us recall that the Council is about to sign the treaty on the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) which focuses on correction . 
But the ESM will only complement the new framework for reinforced economic surveillance , which focuses on prevention and is of primary essence because it will substantially reduce the probability of crises such as we have experienced emerging in the future . 
Let me conclude with a simple message . 
If there is no agreement this week and no vote by the latest in July , it will be a very bad deal for Europe and for Europe ' s citizens . 
And it would only result in frustration , bitterness and a worse outcome for everyone if we must come back to these files in September . 
You have agreed on 99 . 9% of the substance . 
I now ask both sides to go the last few centimetres to reach an agreement with the other . 
It is of paramount importance , since this package really is the cornerstone of our comprehensive response to the crisis that is still ongoing . 
It is absolutely crucial for the credibility of the European Union to conclude the package before the summer break , and then move on and put it into effective use . 
Mr President , President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to make three groups of points on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs . 
The first is that as we adopt this economic governance package , we must ensure that the whole of the Treaty of Lisbon is taken into account . 
According to the Treaty , taking into consideration objectives concerned with promoting a high level of employment , guaranteeing adequate social welfare and combating social exclusion is a cross-cutting aim that applies to this economic governance package also . 
If I may say so , I sometimes get the impression that this aim has been relegated to a secondary priority . 
This is why the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs was keen for the whole package to be based not only on Article 121 of the Treaty , which deals with the coordination of economic policies , but on Article 148 also , which deals with employment policy in terms of coordination between the responsibilities of Member States and the European level . 
This is also why we feel that within the Union , the role of the Employment , Social Policy , Health and Consumer Affairs Council (EPSCO) must be firmly guaranteed , on a par with that of the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (Ecofin) . 
For if - and this brings me to my second group of points - in revising the Stability and Growth Pact our only objective is the kind of governance that will satisfy the rating agencies , then we will be missing an important opportunity in the history of our economic and monetary union . 
History calls us today to take a much more overall view and to look closely at the purposes for which this economic governance is being put in place . 
Of course we need to reduce debt , but we also need to ensure that this economic governance helps to guarantee the success of the Europe 2020 strategy . 
In this respect , we believe there are other approaches that could have been used . 
Commissioner , why is it that only spending on pensions can be given special treatment in your assessment of Member States ' medium-term budget objectives ? 
Why is it that this special treatment cannot also be given to the investment in the future represented by spending on education , or the spending we need to undertake to combat social exclusion , a goal that you set and that we included in the Europe 2020 strategy ? 
Why is it that these aims and this kind of approach are not also applied to spending on research and development or infrastructures ? 
My third group of points relates to how macroeconomic surveillance is conducted . 
We consider it to be an essential outcome of this package , but this means it must be applied symmetrically . 
Ultimately , for us here in the European Parliament , there is a fundamental issue at stake . 
Mrs Ford spoke of it as a power struggle . 
It is not a power struggle , it is a question of democracy . 
If we want there to be European economic governance , there needs to be a space for public debate and for European democracy , in order for this European economic policy to work . 
In this respect , I have to say that your refusal and that of the Council to allow the European Parliament to participate in establishing macroeconomic indicators through delegated acts does not seem to me to be the right approach . 
for David Casa , rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs . - Mr President , Mr Casa has asked me to speak on his behalf because he is not able to be here at this time . 
Many of the amendments from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs have been taken into account by the six-pack rapporteurs . 
We are sending the message that a society can only have a healthy economy when its members are able to contribute fully to its development . 
A healthy economy is the basis for a good level of employment and social policies , and vice versa , a good level of employment and social policies are preconditions for a healthy economy . 
Those Member States which had the most prudent fiscal policies and growth strategies are now performing best . 
This is the proof that fiscal stability leads to growth and employment . 
We need to respect the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact . 
It is essential to achieve growth and jobs and to prevent the debt burden being placed on our children and future generations . 
We have to understand that every euro used in paying interest on the public debt is one which does not go towards investment in education , social security and other fields that provide a necessary environment for the good development of the economy and for the well-being of the people . 
Therefore it is essential that our indebtedness in the Member States is reduced as soon as possible . 
on behalf of the PPE Group . - (DE) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , there are undoubtedly many reasons for the economic situation in which we currently find ourselves in the euro area and in the European Union as a whole , but two stand out in particular . 
Firstly , we were basically far too late in realising the direction in which Europe was sailing . 
Secondly , when we did realise it , the Council in particular refused for a long time to initiate the necessary measures - which are actually provided for in the Stability and Growth Pact - or to impose the necessary sanctions . 
To put it bluntly , it simply failed to pull the ripcord . 
The new regulation on macroeconomic surveillance should deal with these two problems . 
Firstly , the completely new system it provides should enable us to recognise macroeconomic imbalances at an early stage; and secondly , we should then be able to act quickly . 
We have developed a good scoreboard , albeit through long discussions . 
I should very much like to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Ferreira , for her positive cooperation in this connection . 
We need to ensure that immediate measures are taken to counter imbalances . 
That is precisely why it is necessary for a mechanism to be developed here that cannot be politically torpedoed . 
That is why the use of reversed qualified majority voting is so important and so fundamental for Parliament . 
If we want to implement the instrument efficiently , this naturally represents a transfer of powers from the national capitals here to Brussels . 
That is more than likely necessary anyway in an economic and monetary union . 
Only when the citizens of Europe see that we are now acting effectively , that we have learnt from the mistakes we have made , will we be able to regain the trust that has currently been lost . 
I can assure you that my group will be supporting the Ferreira report tomorrow . 
on behalf of the S&D Group . - Mr President , you will not find many members in this room who disagree with the need to drag down debt and deficits to reasonable levels in the years ahead . 
My group certainly takes the view that we need to do that . 
This is not about political confrontation between fiscally virtuous or fiscally irresponsible Members in this House . 
The division between you and us and between progressives and conservatives here in the House is about how we return to sound public finances , at what economic and social cost , at what cost for the future ability of Europe to compete in a global market . 
You stick to the idea , Commissioner , that there is no alternative to your austerity-only agenda . 
We think that this is very wrong . 
In our view , your approach and that of the right-wing majority in the Council pose the biggest threat to the very future of the European idea because they are destroying the notion of belonging to a community , the notions of solidarity and cohesion . 
The vast majority of the millions who have lost their jobs during this crisis are unemployed still today . 
What message does the Council and Commission have for them ? 
Or for the millions whose jobs are in jeopardy or who are living in poverty ? 
What message for the hundreds of millions of people who are suffering as a result of cutbacks in public provision , in healthcare , in education ? 
What message for them ? 
What message from the Council this week ? 
Well , I expect nothing quite frankly , nothing . 
This week ' s Council will not produce a single ray of hope for hardworking people , for the unemployed or the young people who are hurting so much . 
They have been unfairly and severely hit by the crisis that was not of their making and now they will be hit again to repair the damage they did not cause . 
Your political and economic agenda is totally unacceptable to us on this side of the House . 
Throughout the legislative process , we have suggested sensible and balanced amendments to the Commission ' s proposals , we have proposed firmly connecting national reform and stability and growth programmes using the first as a solid vehicle for the necessary promotion of public investment We made proposals to maintain sensible levels of productive public investment and we have proposed making the new rules clearly anti-cyclical . 
I could go on , but the reality is that today ' s economic and social agenda has been hijacked by the right . 
There is not even space for moderate political approaches , let alone more progressive ones . 
And please , Commissioner Rehn , do not tell me that these policies I am denouncing are being pursued by socialist governments . 
You know , at a time when even the strongest economies in Europe need to bow to the demands of an irresponsible and increasingly dangerous financial sector , that no Member State can change this agenda alone . 
In the end , I wonder who will benefit from the decisions that will be made this week . 
It seems to me that the only people who will benefit are those who have caused the whole mess in the first place , the financial sector , and I think that is a disgrace . 
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , so far we have found agreement on almost all of the package and have demonstrated that codecision is working , with thanks to the hard work of the Hungarian Presidency and of course to András Kármán in particular , and to the Parliament negotiating team and the Commission . 
The Presidency and Commission have already highlighted numerous - I think it was 50 - Parliament additions . 
These include a legal framework for the Semester and surveillance of national reform programmes , independence of national statistical offices and fines for fraud , Commission surveillance missions , an economic dialogue between all stakeholders , and substantially greater transparency throughout . 
We cannot conceal , though , that there have been significant differences in the negotiation of the package . 
For my part , I do not see this as political grandstanding but rather the search for ownership , to enable ownership by the people . 
What divides us in Parliament differs from our issues with the Council but , however difficult it may be , we have to stand up to our democratic duty . 
It is this House that will confer ownership . 
Some prefer intergovernmentalism . 
Given that the agreed text is acknowledged as better than the Council general approach , this does not make sense . 
Nor does it make sense in the search for ownership - so distinctly missing in much of the response to the crisis and so much a consequence of intergovernmental decisions . 
From the realisation that the Stability Fund facilities had to be larger , to recognising the fact that punitive interest rates do not give sustainability and the chance to return to the markets , this House has not been afraid to lead and the Council has followed . 
We are stronger when we work together and I believe the final differences can be resolved . 
Mr President , the package of six proposals intended to improve discipline within the euro area is based on the belief that the Member States will comply more rigorously with the newly created and stricter architecture for supranational surveillance . 
I regard it as problematic to think along these lines , particularly since some Member States have been incapable of following the less stringent rules to date , and effectively enforcing their implementation . 
I would like to mention four points which I consider controversial . 
The first is reverse qualified majority voting , which has already been referred to many times in this Chamber . 
We regard reverse qualified majority voting as an instrument to be used in exceptional cases , the use of which must always be explained properly and thoroughly , with proper checks carried out to ensure that its use is consistent with primary law . 
We do not agree with the increase in the number of areas subject to surveillance procedures for which the use of reverse qualified majority voting is proposed . 
The proposed approach will increase the political power of the Commission and the European Parliament to the detriment of the Council and the national authorities , which is not what we want . 
With regard to surveillance missions , I have serious reservations concerning the proposal for such missions , since they will be composed mainly of European Commission officials and will have significant powers entrusted to them , without the members of these missions having any political mandate . 
This is a fundamental reservation . 
People who are not subject to public control by voters , however good their intentions may be , cannot carry out surveillance over the heads of national political bodies or the highest national institutions . 
The scoreboard , which attempts to draw up a list of macroeconomic indicators at supranational level and , based on this list , to assess the ability of national authorities and their economies to deal with economic imbalances , is a contentious idea . 
The current situation in Greece is a good example of the fact that solutions to a situation dictated from outside provoke opposition from the country ' s inhabitants , and are one of the causes of escalating social tension . 
Mr President , the Greens want economic governance . 
Not just to please people , not so that it will make a nice photo , but simply to give the European people instruments , by building on the euro , that will enable them to meet the challenges of the 21st century , in other words to ensure a decent standard of living for everyone , not just for the happy few , and to do it within the planet ' s physical limitations - and this is what is new , of course . 
In this respect , we support these reports on the budget frameworks and the macroeconomic component of the ' economic governance ' package . 
We are satisfied with all the indicators that have been selected , even though we would have liked one of them to have been income inequalities , as they are a very clear sign of both a poorly functioning economy and a poorly functioning society and should therefore act as a warning sign . 
However , our agreement on the macroeconomic component is conditional upon maintaining a symmetrical approach , and this is a point I make to the Council . 
In other words , we believe that all the Member States should be in the same boat , whether they have a current deficit or a surplus , for example . 
There is no reason why we should apply favouritism , as one country ' s surplus is another country ' s deficit . 
As regards the Stability and Growth Pact , we cannot accept an instrument whose only outcome is and will remain austerity , austerity and more austerity , in other words which will result in making only the most vulnerable in our societies pay for the economic crisis . 
We wanted balance , not by having less budget discipline but by combining it with disciplined investment . 
Our proposal was to make the goals that Europe set itself with the EU 2020 strategy not only binding , but as binding as each other and as binding as the rules on the budget or on deficits . 
I am disappointed that a majority could not be found in this Parliament to finally back this strategy and take it more seriously . 
We might have agreed to vote in favour of this stability and growth package unchanged had it been accompanied by an ambitious fiscal package , combining a financial transaction tax , an energy tax , a fair tax on transnational corporations and , of course , measures to combat tax fraud , so that we could help the Union ' s Member States fund the goals they hope to achieve . 
However , there was not the slightest sign of this . 
There is absolutely nothing in the pipeline , despite the declarations that Mr Barroso has made again today . 
I say this to the right: you chose to form a narrow majority with the eurosceptics , as you were free to do , in order to create a form of economic governance which I can tell you now is unfair and will be ineffective . 
We will see what happens , therefore , either in this Parliament when your pact with the eurosceptics has fallen through , or at the polls in France in 2010 and in Germany in 2013 , where I think the voters will agree with us . 
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we , too , call for economic governance in our programme for the European elections in 2009 . 
However , the ideas that we on the left have of economic governance differ from those contained in the economic governance package that is currently on the table . 
For us , economic governance means laying down clear rules for the economy and setting boundaries . 
For example , we feel that this means banning wage dumping and tax dumping , or setting minimum standards to stop competition being distorted on the labour market . 
Naturally , for us economic governance also means effective regulation of the financial markets . 
None of this is to be found in the economic governance package . 
Instead , the current version of the package gives one the impression that it has come about mainly as a result of the pressure exerted by the credit rating agencies on the euro states of southern Europe . 
As can already be seen from the examples of Greece , Portugal and Spain , it establishes a radical austerity policy which has consequences that are hard to predict for the future of the European project as a whole . 
This radical austerity policy is currently driving citizens of Greece , of Portugal and of Spain , but also those of northern European countries , back into an ill-judged nationalism that we thought had long since been vanquished in Europe . 
The much-needed improvements on the Commission ' s original proposals that were elaborated in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and voted through there - particularly in Mrs Ferreira ' s report - have been largely removed again and toned down under pressure from the Council . 
In our view , the removal of the delegated legal acts from the Ferreira report is entirely unacceptable . 
As a result , the European Parliament no longer has any influence over how macroeconomic imbalances are dealt with . 
This is reserved for the Commission . 
It bears little resemblance to democracy , and still less to a social Europe that is equipped to face the future . 
In our view , the economic governance package - at least in its present form - is the wrong answer to the crisis with which we are dealing . 
That is why we will not be supporting the package in its present form . 
Mr President , Commissioner Rehn , ladies and gentlemen , when the euro was introduced it may not have been clear what the loss of monetary policy might involve for a Member State . 
Today we are seeing the dramatic consequences in Greece . 
The euro area was not and has not become an optimal currency zone . 
A country hit by the financial crisis finds it more difficult to recover and could well drag other Member States into the abyss . 
From Maastricht onwards , criteria have existed which are designed to prevent dangerous situations , and we have seen how miserably they have failed . 
In 1999 Greece did not meet any criteria , and only two years later it was already in the euro . 
Portugal , moreover , was the first country to receive warnings in 2002 about its deficit position . 
Even in the past , then , there were signs , but now all European citizens could end up paying the consequences . 
We are waiting to see , therefore , whether these new measures prove any more useful . 
They are probably the last chance before the definitive failure of European economic policy is declared . 
(DE) Mr President , the drama surrounding the European Union is turning into a tragedy . 
Tomorrow it will probably come down to every last vote . 
As someone directly elected by 500 000 voters in Austria , how can I endorse this package ? 
We can now explain the concept of economic governance even to highly eurosceptic people , but not if it has no democratic legitimacy and there are no checks and balances . 
How is it supposed to work if , on the one hand , a protectorate is de facto established - Greece - and on the other the taxpayers in better-off nations have their bonds plundered via the European Central Bank and the bad banks ? 
How can you explain to people who were adamant that they should not give up the schilling and the mark that we now suddenly need Eurobonds simply because the banks cannot be kept in check - by the way , Mr Hughes , it is very nice that the social democrats have now realised this . 
The only way I can imagine that is if we finally give in and say we should have done this , that or the other at the time; if we admit our mistakes and , as Europe burns around us , finally put forward a vision in which we are able to survive globalisation . 
I do not see this in the current package , however , and that is why - quite apart from individual points - it is so difficult for any responsibly-minded person to vote for it . 
(LV) Mr President , it is the case that homes are typically designed by people with higher education , but are typically built by people who barely have secondary education . 
What is more , if , during the construction of a home , there happens to be a building worker who is either foolish or dishonest , and does not pour the necessary amount of concrete into the foundations as called for in the design , then the home will be crooked . 
In the case of the eurozone , the foundations , the stability foundations , were laid with the Stability and Growth Pact . 
Unfortunately it has come to pass that various Member States - perhaps like lazy or careless building workers - did not adhere to the stability pact and created excessively large government debts , budget deficits . 
When the world economic crisis came about , this eurozone house began to totter . 
If the eurozone were a house , then logically , we should have to set to work again and lay new foundations . 
In this case we have a completed economic governance package , which we should approve , in the way of reinforced foundations , so that in the future , when the next storm comes along , the eurozone cannot totter . 
In addition , if we want to have some idea of what this tottering looks like , we need only look at events in Greece . 
Ladies and gentlemen , we need to avoid the situation where in the future our house could totter once more , and the solution is to approve the economic government package . 
Thank you for your attention . 
(DE) Mr President , I should like to begin my comments with a question to Commissioner Rehn and to Mr Kármán of the Council . 
Both have spoken of an outstanding matter in the argument between the parliamentary majority and the Council . 
This week I noted that the Council had opposed text in the report by Mrs Ferreira , the rapporteur for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament , concerning the symmetrical approach . 
Are you able to tell me that this problem has been resolved , because the Council voted in favour of the rapporteur ? 
In actual fact , you would then still have a problem between the majority here and the Council - or did you forget to mention that ? 
If so , I should like to know that too , because then I would think that you consider it unimportant . 
I should like the two of you to explain this to me at the end of this debate . 
Listening to the two conservative groups in this House , and also to the liberals , I get the impression that if we adopt what they have tabled here then the world will be put to rights . 
Unfortunately , that is not the case . 
The world would subsequently be worse , not better - because they have turned an opportunity to create a more common economic policy in Europe into an austerity package . 
That is a bad thing , because it represents a policy that dates from the last century , because it represents an outdated approach which merely takes sanctions regimes from political techniques and not incentives , or smart taxation , or balanced approaches such as have been represented by us . 
Various sides of the House have made sufficient pragmatic proposals to allow a balanced package to be tabled . 
If Mrs Wortmann-Kool wants to claim that it would be blocked by the greens and the social democrats , that is of course simply nonsense . 
Exactly the opposite is true . 
To the Members of this House from the Group of the European People ' s Party (Christian Democrats) - who run after either the Commission or the Council - I would state that we are not here to let things through on the nod , but rather to think for ourselves . 
That is what the voters expect of us . 
I must therefore point out to you that at present you cannot tell whether a Member State is buying defence hardware , fighter aircraft or investing in its education system of tomorrow . 
You are not in a position to make a qualitative assessment of its budgetary policy . 
We do , in fact , want to equip you to do so . 
We wanted a smarter pact which provides greater opportunity for the Commission to have an influence . 
I cannot understand why Commissioner Rehn is not agreeing to this - more opportunities for influence and a modern economic policy which makes reference to the EU2020 objectives in the interests of our citizens . 
You have derailed it , and that is a pity . 
Consequently , this package is by no means balanced . 
We will continue to fight for a better economic package . 
We owe this to our electorate . 
In truth , the answer has to be ' more Europe ' , not ' less Europe ' . 
It has to be the right Europe , however - not the wrong package . 
(SV) Mr President , Commissioner , Europe is in a difficult situation , but it is precisely in times of crisis that the EU is usually able to take bold decisions . 
The fact that tomorrow we will be able to take a decision on stricter and clearer rules for economic governance is extremely important , not just for the countries within the euro area . 
Everyone will be affected . 
Europe ' s leaders have hesitated and created uncertainty . 
The nervousness has spread . 
Their message changed from day to day . 
The decision tomorrow will be able to demonstrate that Parliament is able to take difficult decisions in difficult times . 
Greece used deceit to enable it to join the euro area . 
That is true . 
That is precisely why the German and French leaders are now showing clear leadership and taking responsibility for Europe ' s future , rather than continuing to talk in unclear , muted tones . 
The Stability and Growth Pact must be reformed and the rules tightened up . 
Pacta sunt servanda - agreements must be kept - not a new Greece ! 
In Sweden , we know that the way to stability and growth is through healthy state finances . 
Mr Bullman can ask the Swedish members of his group . 
It is my hope that the Swedish Social Democrats will be able to support this proposal , particularly as we have managed to get rules through that safeguard the Swedish collective agreements . 
Now the last impediment is being removed to enable the Swedish Social Democrats to be instrumental in Sweden becoming a member of the Euro Plus Pact . 
If Sweden is to belong to the EU ' s inner circle , we cannot simply trudge along behind EU critics from Hungary , the Czech Republic and the United Kingdom . 
That is not good company to keep . 
Mr President , I find myself in a difficult position in this debate as I believe that strong fiscal rules are necessary for a strong currency and a strong economy . 
This , I believe , was the fundamental reason why my country did not join the euro . 
Monetary union was always going to be difficult without significant steps towards economic union and it is this latter requirement which means I do not think the UK will ever join the euro . 
For my political group here in Parliament , national sovereignty over decisions on economic policy is a fundamental principle . 
If all six of these reports and their rules only apply to the euro zone , we would be able to more actively support the Euro Group in their decision to strengthen the principles that underpin their monetary union . 
If all the Member States who use the euro want to strengthen and deepen the coordination of their economic policies , then that should be their decision . 
The UK and other non-euro-zone countries want to be good neighbours . 
However , attempts to bind those of us outside the euro zone with targets and processes designed to harmonise economic policy are unacceptable . 
I do not wish to see the euro zone in prolonged difficulty , but the ECR cannot support EU legislation that transfers any further powers away from national governments who are currently outside of that euro zone . 
All Member States will hopefully have learned the lessons of the crisis , namely that a balanced budget and strong fiscal discipline are rewarded by lower funding costs in the financial markets , and that honesty in statistical reporting is essential for continued market confidence . 
Fundamentally , a strong euro zone and the euro as a global currency are in all of our interests . 
New rules need to ensure it is made stronger and more sustainable . 
(DE) Mr President , we in the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance want to see strong European economic governance . 
This means that on the one hand we need strong rules for dealing with imbalances - as set out in Mrs Ferreira ' s report - and naturally we also need sanctions for these . 
That is why we will be voting in favour of these two reports , just as we will for the report by Mrs Ford , which provides the statistical basis for our economic cooperation . 
Likewise , as regards the three reports on the Stability and Growth Pact: a common euro , and in addition we need limits in Europe on deficits and debt . 
Such limits have been exceeded in this crisis . 
However , it is important to consider how the deficits and debt are reduced . 
At present we are seeing time and again in Greece , Portugal and Ireland that , under pressure from the European Commission , in negotiations with the national governments results and packages have been put together in which it is the weakest that suffer , and in which the wealthy - who did very well out of the previous 20 years - are left alone . 
This has shaken people ' s faith in the process . 
That is why we in the Group of the Greens want the EU2020 objectives to be fully binding in the Stability and Growth Pact and in the reports , and also the deficit and debt objectives . 
In not accepting this , ladies and gentlemen of the liberal and conservative groups , you have opted out of one of the principles of social cohesion in Europe . 
We cannot support that . 
We consider it highly regrettable , because we would have liked to have seen a broad pro-European majority here in Parliament . 
If these reports do not get a majority tomorrow then we are always prepared to work together constructively to achieve a common solution for economic governance that takes social and economic responsibilities equally seriously . 
(EL) Mr President , for us in the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left , this economic governance package is not only the wrong response to the crisis; it also marks the end of Europe as we know it . 
Its objective is not economic coordination and fiscal discipline , as it maintains; it is to impose a permanent austerity memorandum throughout Europe , on all the workers . 
The objective of the ' European semester ' and national stability and reform programmes is not convergence; it is to abolish collective agreements , liberalise redundancies , privatise industry and do away with public pension systems . 
These policies do not serve the interests of the people of Europe or their hope of real growth . 
On the contrary , they serve the interests of the banks , which have knowingly kept toxic bonds subject to large-scale international speculation on their books , and the interests of large corporations which have found , in the common market , a haven for speculation and tax evasion . 
I would mention , by way of example , the German company Hochtief , which manages Athens Airport; it has not paid a euro since 2001 and owes EUR 500 million in VAT . 
There is a great deal of discussion about Greece . 
For a year now , the essence of the economic governance package has been applied to my country with disastrous consequences: the recession is getting worse , inflation has gone through the roof , investments have completely dried up , labour rights and collective agreements have basically been repealed , the biggest drop in the cost of labour has been in Europe , unemployment has reached 20% and debt has increased , fuelling a dangerous vicious circle of recession , debt and more borrowing . 
That is why angry Greek workers have taken to the streets and squares , fighting to get austerity policies overturned , to defend their income and to defend their labour and social rights , real growth and a better future for Greece and Europe . 
(ES) Mr President , we aspire to the creation of an economic government area subject to the principles of federalism , albeit adapted to the process of European integration . 
We can no longer close our eyes to the situation . 
There is an inconsistency in having a common currency but lacking the fiscal and financial instruments needed alongside it . 
Specifically , we need: the issuance of common European bonds , the outright rejection of competition between the bonds issued by the different Member States , the establishment of a genuinely European treasury and the harmonisation of fiscal policies to ensure equality , combat tax fraud and help to define a progressive European social policy based on efficient public services . 
Some may say these ideas are elementary . 
They must nonetheless be repeated time and again because nobody listens to them . 
It is for this very reason , that is to say not listening , that we are living in dark times , as anticipated by the poet Bertolt Brecht . 
(ES) Mr President , when I first entered this House 20 years ago , this debate would not have taken place , because this House was a consultative parliament at the time , and many of us have battled over the last 20 years to make it what it is today , a co-legislator parliament . 
However , when one co-legislates , one must be responsible . 
It is an exercise in responsibility that is now in need . 
A part of this House has adopted the old May 1968 slogan , according to which it is realistic to demand the impossible . 
Obviously , if one demands the impossible , it ultimately becomes impossible to agree on anything . 
The Group of the European People ' s Party (Christian Democrats) has not negotiated with any individual groups . 
We have negotiated with all the groups . 
However , we have only reached agreements with those that were ready to do so . 
Mr President , it is my belief that much progress has undeniably been made with the Commission ' s proposal , the Council ' s position and what is now on the table - which will be put to the vote tomorrow - if they are examined objectively . 
This is the real controversy or dilemma that we will have to resolve tomorrow . 
At the end of his fruitful existence , Miguel de Cervantes said that there were moments in life when one must choose whether to be a road or an inn . 
By being an inn , Cervantes meant lying still , complaining that one is ignored and remaining static . 
Being a road means moving forward , overcoming obstacles , knowing that not all has been achieved , that the road is probably not the one we would like to be walking on , but going on walking all the same . 
This is what I believe this House should do tomorrow: walk on , resolve the differences we still have with the Council , but look towards a time when the crisis is hitting all Europeans . 
It is not responsible at this juncture to say ' I am not happy with this , goodbye , have a nice day ' . 
Responsibility means walking . 
Therefore , Mr President , I think that in tomorrow ' s vote we will convene another meeting with the Council to be held in July . 
As another poet used to say - Mr Sosa Wagner has quoted a German poet , I will quote a French one , Paul Valéry - poems are never finished , they are simply abandoned . 
We will abandon the end result until July , and I hope that the Hungarian Presidency , which has proved so successful , will also be able to reach an agreement that satisfies everyone . 
Thank you , Mr President , and may I point out that this is the first time in 20 years that the clock has erred in my favour , giving me more time . 
(MT) The six reports on economic governance amount to a complex package for the European Union , especially for the eurozone . 
Those who put the package together find it hard enough to explain and it is even harder for people on the outside to understand it . 
It is understandable that people are perplexed , both by the crisis that is unravelling before them , and by our unclear and timid reaction to it . 
This is why the responsibility lies with us to explain our voting choices to our constituents; to say whether we are for or against each and every one of these reports . 
Briefly , the package which the Commission presented us with was intended to cover the three phases of how one should react to the crisis . 
Primarily , this package focuses on crisis prevention , mitigation and solution . 
The Wortmann-Kool , Feio and Goulard report discuss the use of sanctions at length as the main tools required to prevent a country from reaching dangerous deficit and debt levels , and the scenarios that arise when these countries ignore the various warnings issued to them on their dire fiscal situation . 
Originally , the reports squabbled over the severity of the fines that should be imposed , although later on more moderate suggestions were accepted . 
The hardest and more creative way of mitigating the crisis , by avoiding macroeconomic imbalances through the use of scoreboards that determine the targets to be reached , was left to the Ferreira report . 
Despite technical restrictions and other pressures , this report managed at least to attain a minimum set of desired objectives . 
Anyone hoping to find a solution to the current crisis within this package will be doing so in vain . 
This package lacks well thought out , sensible ideas by European and foreign economists on how the affected countries can overcome this crisis . 
One report that made an effort to build a consensus on securities for the euro was side-lined at the last minute by the Council and has now simply been shelved by the Commission , accompanied by a promise to carry out further studies on the subject . 
We have nothing in hand that is concrete; we have merely ended up with a promise unto a promise . 
We must keep in mind that the whole point of this exercise was to help Europe get back to its feet , to pull it out of the mire and to ensure that it can move forward and become globally competitive . 
For this reason , we should not oppose the idea that eurozone countries need to reduce their excess fiscal burdens . 
We agree that nobody should compete while carrying around such a heavy burden . 
However , one cannot accept the imposition of a crash diet that would only serve to further sicken and weaken . 
Europe needs to build some economic muscle; it needs creative schemes in order to strengthen economic growth and create jobs . 
It is greatly disappointing that after all these months , not one of the intelligent proposals that were on the cards ended up in this package . 
(DE) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , for a long time we believed that the internal market and the introduction of a common currency would automatically result in economic convergence and convergence of the Member States , and that the Maastricht criteria were sufficient to ensure discipline . 
Reality has now caught up with us . 
The management instruments have proved to be inadequate and in the past they have been grossly transgressed . 
A single currency and a single monetary policy are not feasible in the long term unless the rules have teeth in the area of fiscal , budgetary , economic and social policy . 
The EU is now trying a new approach . 
To speak metaphorically , it has one last shot . 
If this last shot fails to hit the target , the damage could be severe . 
The EU could find itself in a regressive phase , we could see the return of renationalisation and protectionism , and the first signs of disintegration in the euro area . 
The new package attempts to prevent this and to lay a new foundation . 
I am in favour of this package , even though I consider it rather half-hearted in view of the problems that I have just outlined . 
There is a risk that the European semester will turn out to be a centralist , bureaucratic exercise . 
The pact for the euro may possibly be toothless . 
What we need are binding recommendations from the Commission . 
What we need are automatic initiatives and sanctions which the Council can only stop by means of reversed qualified majority voting . 
This is undoubtedly necessary if the disgraceful , opaque wrangles by Council members in back rooms are finally to be brought to an end . 
What we urgently need is a clear resolution mechanism for the financial sector so that it can work again . 
(NL) Mr President , it has become clear that a monetary union requires a budgetary union , as well as compliance with the rules . 
That is the lesson to be learned from the euro crisis . 
I find the package we agreed last Wednesday to be very well balanced and I therefore have the honour to inform you , Commissioner , that the Belgian delegation within the European Conservatives and Reformists will be endorsing this package . 
I do have some points of criticism , however . 
On the whole , I think that Eurobonds are not a miracle solution . 
Yesterday , Gideon Rachman wrote in the Financial Times that you cannot cure alcohol poisoning with a bottle of vodka . 
I have had theological debates on this issue with Mrs Goulard . 
We could not agree , but I admire her as an opponent . 
I also think that the theory of economic imbalances is rather vague and unclear . 
It is not true that Germany has a trade surplus because Portugal has a trade deficit . 
That really would read like ' EU economics for dummies ' . 
Therefore , Mr President , we have before us the best text achievable . 
I will vote in favour of it and I think that , at this moment and in this period of crisis in the euro area , we and this Parliament are being called upon to deliver and that is what I would like to do . 
(EL) Mr President , the package of economic governance measures creates an strong tool for imposing capitalist restructurings in a uniform manner and a uniform strategy in all the Member States , in order to strengthen the competitiveness , profitability and power of capital . 
This is a permanent memorandum for the working classes in all the Member States of the European Union . 
The vulgar propaganda about Greece ' s , Ireland ' s , Portugal ' s and other countries ' debts and deficits is designed to blame the rights acquired by the working classes and to conceal the real culprit , which is capitalism and its monopolies . 
The ideological terrorism of the bourgeois class being promoted is that the only way out is to slaughter the workers so as to keep the profitability of capital intact . 
Between 1985 and 2011 alone , apart from the immeasurable wealth appropriated by capital from exploiting the working class in Greece , monopoly capital at home and abroad plundered EUR 628 billion in interest and repayments , either as lender or borrower . 
The working class owes nothing to those who have robbed them of what they earned by the sweat of their brow . 
On the contrary , they are owed all the wealth plundered by capital . 
The message sent out by the Greek Communist Party from the rock of the Acropolis echoes more topically than ever today: ' Nations of Europe arise . 
Overturn the capitalist barbarity and the sovereignty of the monopolies . ' 
(DE) Mr President , the more we guarantee in the future European stabilisation mechanism , the more dependent the sound states become on the overindebted periphery of the EU . 
Centralisation and a single currency , which could never be a hard currency in the long term , have contributed to the current problems , yet a continuation along this wrong path is precisely what is now being proposed to us as a solution to rescue us . 
Economically strong and weak economies are first arbitrarily thrown together in the same pot . 
Then we make recourse to various rescue measures - all in vain - and now the whole thing is to culminate in European economic governance . 
In my opinion , if overindebted economies want to remain in the euro area then they must be subjected to strict budgetary control instead . 
The sort of centralisation which takes the form of Brussels exerting budgetary authority over all the Member States represents improper intervention in the sovereignty of the Member States , however , and would moreover reduce the sound countries of Europe to mere playthings of EU bureaucracy . 
In my opinion , we should be bolting the door against Brussels ' creeping desire for ever more centralisation . 
Mr President , our task and responsibility here is to ensure that both Member States and the Union as a whole emerge stronger from the crisis , and the economic governance package takes us in this direction . 
The package - politically unthinkable prior to the crisis and certainly not yet perfect - is indeed a major step forward . 
It is obvious , however , that to get an agreement is one thing - and it is our duty here - but to see its practical implementation and then to benefit from new rules will be yet another challenge . 
This reform , introducing a greater amount of automaticity over political bargaining and discretion , will have to pass the test of real life and this will require a strong political will and an attitude of accountability . 
It is unclear how long it will take before all the institutional arrangements are in place and new rules start bearing their fruit . 
This uncertainty creates risks and we must not create additional space for these risks . 
It also remains unclear how the interplay between the European Semester and the new economic governance infrastructure will function , and I also have concerns about the permanent European Stability Mechanism emerging as an intergovernmental tool . 
I hope that our agreement on the six-pack will pave the way for these instruments to be eventually converted into the Community-based ones . 
To conclude , let me say that the economic governance package gives us a chance that the winner / loser attitude will disappear from our European reality and that Europe will not become a zero sum game . 
(FR) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , our fellow citizens are questioning the merits of austerity policies that are reducing their public services and squeezing their social security . 
Wherever these policies are rife , they are not succeeding in reducing public debt and bringing down unemployment . 
The contents of this ' governance ' package - and I call them ' contents ' deliberately - that we are discussing today are so ridiculous that even the economists are stunned , because they will prevent budgetary policy from adjusting to economic cycles . 
During the trialogue , the Commission representatives admitted to us themselves that they have not used any theoretical or econometric model as a basis for making sound predictions and recommendations . 
They admit that they are working on a purely intuitive basis . 
In the light of this , it is difficult to understand why the conservative , liberal and eurosceptic Members of this House have blindly attempted to toughen up the text proposed by the Commission . 
They are even less in a position to preach to us , considering that the governments led by friends of theirs have created these deficits through tax reductions that are as unfair as they are ineffective: is that not right , Mr Gauzès ? 
They make grand statements about the Europe 2020 strategy , but they refuse to allow spending to prepare for the future , such as spending on investment , to be excluded from the calculation of the deficits . 
Yes , Mrs Wortmann-Kool , that is the crux of the debate as far as we are concerned ! 
Let us reduce the deficits , yes , for example by going back on the tax gifts that have benefited the State ' s creditors above all , but let us do it without sacrificing investment , training and jobs , because today ' s investments are tomorrow ' s jobs and the tax income that will follow , and this will allow us to reduce our deficits . 
This is the theorem that should appear on the frontispiece of the ' governance ' package . 
My fellow conservative and liberal Members , some of you want to punish automatically States that are heretics to your dogma to the tune of billions of euros . 
They also want to punish countries that will not lower wages in order to regain their external balance . 
They believe that the deficits are primarily the product of bad intentions on the part of those States , as though the neoliberal model that you never question had not just been through its worst crisis since 1929 , and as if it were not already leading to pressure on the buying power of ordinary people and causing a massive contraction in tax income: two problems that were at the root of the rise in private and public indebtedness in the first place . 
When it comes to the votes , socialists and democrats will send out a clear signal against this austerity package , which can only heighten the indignation that is rising throughout Europe . 
This clear signal is aimed at all workers in Europe and especially at our fellow citizens in France and Germany as they approach elections that will have a decisive impact on Europe ' s future . 
Mr President , first of all I would like to thank all the rapporteurs for the great job they have done , especially my colleagues and friends Sylvie Goulard and Carl Haglund . 
Our vote on the economic governance package could be one of those historical turning points for this Parliament . 
Not only through its direct consequences , but also by the moral stand that we show our citizens . It is time for politics and governments to take a more robust stand on what is wrong and what is right in the values that we want to defend , including in the economic field . 
Do we want governments that lie about their budgets or their deficits ? 
We do not , because even though you can deny reality for a while , it always strikes back in the end . 
Moreover , do we want governments that comply with the Stability and Growth Pact ? 
I think we do . 
Thus , managing sanctions is necessary . 
We know that if Member States have to sanction each other , nothing will happen . 
That is why I fully support the reversed qualified majority , also in the name of my party , the Catalan Liberal coalition , which is now running the Government of Catalonia and also the government of the city of Barcelona . 
Automaticity is much needed if we want to be sure that red lines are not freely trespassed . 
Furthermore , there is the call for the Commission to make a proposal on euro securities . 
I would like to publicly support this as a proposal that takes into account the feature of fiscal discipline . 
(NL) Mr President , the Greek crisis is one of the factors forming the basis of this debate . 
Lending more money to the Greeks and demanding they implement more cuts is unwise . 
The Greeks will never be able to repay the loans and an economy which is as good as dead cannot make cuts . 
You cannot ask a skeleton to tighten its belt . 
What do we need , then ? 
First of all , those in this House who brought Greece into the euro area should confess their guilt , as should the Belgian Finance Minister , Mr Reynders . 
Obviously , this should never have been allowed to happen . 
Secondly , part of the Greek debt must be written off and , in order to ensure that the residual debt is indeed repaid , a multi-year recovery plan for the Greek economy should be drawn up . 
Thirdly , the Stability and Growth Pact should include automatic sanctions against those who break the terms of euro membership , as we should never again allow ourselves to slide into this misery . 
On this point , I think that the Wortmann-Kool report could have been more stringent . 
Mr President , I support the ' six-pack ' , but because of this point I will abstain from voting on the Wortmann-Kool report . 
(PT) Mr President , this legislative package is not an answer to the severe economic and social problems being experienced in many countries , which are affecting workers and people in general . 
They originate basically in increasingly neoliberal EU policies that concentrate financial and political power in the hands of the few . 
In expanding the demands of the Stability and Growth Pact and making penalties tougher , the outcome of the negotiations reveals the political consensus that exists between the three institutions on the course and main alignments of the European Union . 
It forms part of an unprecedented attack on the rights of the national parliaments , which are constrained by the EU ' s neoliberal guidelines for their countries ' budgets , the aim being to impose austerity measures on workers and people , privatisations and public investment cuts in essential sectors and services . 
Since the workers ' struggles in Greece , Ireland and Portugal have been in vain , as we know , it is time to do a U-turn and to stop insisting on benefiting only economic and financial business groups , above all in the major European powers . 
What these legislative documents propose is to perpetuate these intervention measures , which subjugate peoples and countries and transform them into veritable protectorates or colonies . 
They propose going further down a path that can only lead to economic and social disaster and the actual implosion of the European Union . 
We are therefore against them . 
(FR) Mr President , Commissioner , Minister , ladies and gentlemen , many comments have already been made on the different reports that make up this governance package . 
What are the most important points , at this stage , to help us appraise the work that has been done ? 
The fact that we have this package today , which is the result of negotiations between the Council and Parliament , already constitutes considerable progress . 
It fills an obvious gap in the development of the euro , and sadly it took the debt crisis to prompt us to do this . 
In this respect , we should stress the commendable work done by the Hungarian Presidency and the quality of the negotiators from this Parliament . 
I would also like to emphasise the results that Parliament obtained in the discussions with the Council , as the latter demonstrated genuine openness . 
We must remember how the situation used to be and measure the improvements objectively . 
Having said this , are these provisions satisfactory , and are they enough ? 
There is always room for improvement , of course , but this package already provides real solutions to strengthen the euro area and to create the concerted economic approach that is needed . 
Can we seriously argue , as the opponents of this package do , that we can build growth on top of a mountain of debt that is continuously put off further and further into the future ? 
To those who blame us for supporting a governance package that is not based on any theoretical or econometric model , I will simply say this: did the models you are talking about foresee or prevent the crisis we are going through and that has not ended yet; or did they lead , instead , to high-risk behaviours under the cover of mathematical truth ? 
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , tomorrow Parliament will have to make its decision , and I hope it will send out a signal loud and clear , both to our citizens , to restore their confidence in Europe , and to the markets , to stabilise our currency . 
Composition of Parliament: see Minutes
Prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances - Implementation of excessive deficit procedure - Requirements for budgetary frameworks of Member States - Budgetary surveillance in euro area - Surveillance of budgetary positions and surveillance and coordination of economic policies - Enforcement measures to correct excessive macroeconomic imbalances in euro area (continuation of debate)
The next item is the debate on prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances; excessive deficit procedure; requirements for budgetary frameworks of Member States; budgetary surveillance in the euro area; surveillance of budgetary positions and surveillance and coordination of economic policies; and enforcement measures to correct excessive macroeconomic imbalances in the euro area . 
(ES) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , our citizens want a strong and effective European Union . 
Sluggishness , inadequacy and a purely intergovernmental vision are worsening the impact of the crisis and weakening the credibility of the European project . 
We are not facing problems that are purely national , or a crisis that is only economic; we are facing a political crisis that requires a swift , full , Europeanist response . 
The basic concepts of ' economy ' and ' union ' in the Economic and Monetary Union must be strengthened . 
The proposal presented today on economic governance must be considerably improved if we are going to achieve that . 
We are in favour of creating national budgetary frameworks that guarantee transparency , economic coordination and verification of compliance with European commitments . 
We believe it is necessary to correct macroeconomic imbalances and move toward convergence , and we find that the Ferreira report makes particular progress in that area . 
However , the proposals to reform the Stability and Growth Pact are incomplete: they confuse stability with adjustment , and they entrust growth policies to the market and the national sphere . 
Avoiding Europe ' s commitment to investment and employment is not acceptable . 
We will not be complicit in this attempt to make Europe turn its back on its citizens and its own interests; we are not resigned to impassively pondering the way in which our problems are getting worse; and we do not accept double standards . 
We need unanimity to provide resources and qualified majority decisions to avoid penalties . 
We must pledge our commitment to Europe and do it quickly . 
The European Parliament should work hard to make an ambitious , Europeanist response worthy of our citizens . 
We need to move forwards , not backwards like crabs . 
Europe must not hide when it is needed most . 
Mr President , although the United Kingdom is not a member of the euro zone - and I hope it never will be - we have a vested interest in its success . 
I wish the euro zone well and I regret that I am unable to support the proposals on economic governance we are debating tonight . 
The proposals before us grant the Commission sweeping new powers . 
Had these powers been limited to euro zone countries alone , I would not have objected , but instead we see the Commission and many Members in this Parliament - including Ms Wortmann-Kool , for whom I have the utmost respect - using the crisis in the euro zone as an excuse to extend the power of the EU into the economic governance of the United Kingdom and other countries who do not use the euro . 
I was not elected to grant the EU more powers over the way the United Kingdom governs its affairs and I shall therefore vote against these proposals . 
(DE) Mr President , the debate reflects the unresolved issues of economic policy in Europe . 
Whilst we have a central monetary policy , there is local responsibility for budgetary and finance policies . 
The attempts by some Greek Members to shift the responsibility for Greece ' s internal political competence onto Europe , or to third parties , to capitalist banks , or to whomever , can only be a mistake . 
(Heckling)
It was the Greek communists . 
Fortunately , the euro is stable both internally and externally . 
What we are dealing with is not a crisis of the euro , but rather a sovereign debt crisis . 
That is where we must start . 
It is pointless - even the state cannot live beyond its means indefinitely . 
It is pointless adding further debt to existing debts without accepting the consequences of necessary reforms . 
That is why I say it is high time that we acted . 
Parliament has been calling for measures for a long time . 
The Commission has now proposed that the Stability and Growth Pact be tightened up . 
The Hungarian Presidency has negotiated well , as has our side . 
I actually think it a pity , Mr Bullmann - for on many aspects of regulation of the financial markets we are very much in agreement - that the socialists still want to distinguish between good and bad debt . 
That is the wrong way to go . 
When we draw up the balance sheets to see which countries of Europe have got into difficulties there is no need to defame anyone; it is easy to see . 
There were socialist governments everywhere that these budgetary and financial problems have arisen . 
Hungary , Latvia , Romania , outside the euro area , Ireland , Spain , Portugal , the United Kingdom and Greece too , apart from a break of four years , when our lot were in . 
In other words , your economic model does not work . 
(Heckling)
Really , Mr Bütikofer , you should know better by now . 
We cannot absolve the Greeks of responsibility here and I will say quite frankly that the Greeks were not the first to contravene the Stability and Growth Pact; rather it was the two big ones , Germany and France . 
We also objected to that and changed it . 
You were in the government at the time , Mr Bütikofer . 
You dug the grave - it was your party that dug the grave of the Stability and Growth Pact , not the Greeks . 
Now , however , it is for the Greeks to . . . 
(The President cut off the speaker . )
(The speaker agreed to take two blue-card questions under Rule 149(8) of the Rules of Procedure)
(DE) Mr President , Mr Langen , I just want to make sure that you are familiar with our ideas . 
I am therefore asking you whether you are aware of what we proposed to your colleague , Mrs Wortmann-Kool , which was firstly that we strengthen the pact by including closer monitoring of selected objectives proposed by Mr Rehn from the EU2020 package , such as research and development and the fight against poverty . 
This would also include investment in modernising energy supply systems . 
(FR) Mr President , I have two points . 
First , Greece: let us not try to re-write history . 
This was a right-wing government which for two terms of office disguised the figures with the help of Goldman Sachs Bank . 
Today , a left-wing government is trying to get things back into shape . 
Is it the people who should be paying for the mistakes made on the advice of banking corporations ? 
Second example: in my country , Belgium , under a government with left-wing participation led by our fellow Member Mr Dehaene , in 12 years we reduced our debt from 130% of GDP to 80% . 
Mistakes by the banking community , and by Fortis in particular , meant that we had to help out the banks in order to prevent the system . . . 
(The President cut off the speaker)
(DE) Mr President , I am very familiar with the proposals made by Mr Bullmann and the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament . 
The only problem with them was that they primarily want more money . 
The problem cannot be solved by throwing more money at it . 
As Mr Tarabella has just confirmed , there are opportunities for debt reduction even with socialist involvement . 
I want to spell it out that the reforms that have taken place in Greece have done nothing to result in the large amount of private Greek wealth genuinely sharing the burden of the costs of the state . 
On the contrary: since 1 January EUR 59 billion has been withdrawn from Greek bank deposits by Greek citizens , and since 1 January EUR 12 billion of Greek government bonds have been sold . 
I am demanding that the many wealthy parties in Greece participate actively , and this must be regulated by policy . 
If they can accept responsibility , then they will be able to benefit from our solidarity . 
(NL) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to start by paying tribute to all those who have been working hard on this package of late , but I also support the previous speakers from my group . 
To us , this package is not sufficient and it is not balanced . 
This is not so much a matter of technical detail , but of essence: what are we putting the emphasis upon ? 
What should be the objectives for a more integrated economic policy ? 
It is therefore not true that we do not want European economic governance , but we do need to ask ourselves how we should define it , what the essence of European economic governance is . 
Obviously , the current crisis has made it clear that a monetary union also requires economic cooperation . 
It seems that some sort of design error has crept into our financial blueprint and we need to rectify that . 
For us , this is about much more than just agreeing to cuts and achieving budgetary objectives . 
Yes , Mr Langen and ladies and gentlemen , we are indeed in favour of sound public finances , but what is key for us is how we can all move forward , how we can crawl out of this morass . 
How we can prepare for the future and , therefore , how we can create growth and employment through a common economic policy . In other words , by integrating an ambitious investment strategy into the system , by forging a link with the 2020 objectives , or to put it another way , by making joint arrangements , for example , to improve our education system , fight poverty and become more competitive and take on the competition from third countries through investment in research and development . 
By the way , it amazes me that some members , as was the case with Mr Verhofstadt just yesterday , are advocating an investment strategy while being content with this package . 
For me , personally , that is not consistent . 
We therefore consider the ' six-pack ' to be a missed opportunity to put genuine economic governance in place . 
(NL) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we are in a very deep crisis , and not only one from which we have to ensure that we extricate ourselves , but also one which we must prevent ourselves from ever landing in again . 
It is for that very reason that we need a strong legislative framework and for that very reason that we , as a co-legislator , as Parliament , also have to shoulder our responsibilities . 
After all , we are the generation that is currently deciding the future of our children . 
We , in the Group of the European People ' s Party (Christian Democrats) have the courage to push through such a set of rules . 
We must now have the courage to decide what action is needed . 
We must also have the courage to choose to push such decisions through , to ensure they are complied with , even if that means we have to swim against the tide . 
We understand the people who are taking to the streets to protest and , what is more , what we are doing is giving a precise structural answer to those people ' s concerns: good jobs , sustainable growth and room in the future for an adequate social policy . 
If we want to remain a relevant player in a globalised economy , then we have to ensure greater coordination between economic and budgetary policies , as well as greater coordination between the economic policy and the policy on the competitiveness of Member States . 
To that end , we obviously need investment in the economy but what we need , first of all , is to ensure that no one is allowed the liberty to depart from agreed rules without a valid reason , because that means dragging others into the quagmire as well . 
The package that eventually came out of the negotiations provides a strong answer to those requirements , and it also provides an answer to the mistakes of the past . 
The only thing is - and this is prompted by our behaviour in the past - that we must further strengthen the preventive aspect of the Stability Pact , because if a Member State goes down the wrong road , then we cannot allow it to become subject to political bargaining in the Council , which is ultimately what the response from Europe will be . 
I therefore hope that we here will be casting a vote in favour , that we will support this package , but also that we will give ourselves the opportunity to start a final round of negotiations with the Council in order to strengthen this point further . 
(IT) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I believe that we are witnessing a paradox . 
The package that should correct and prevent imbalances and asymmetries is based on an imbalance and a lack of symmetry . 
It is like a body that stands on two legs , but one is much longer and more developed than the other . 
The leg that controls fiscal policy is muscular and articulated , while the one that controls development policy , which should provide impetus and long-term drive , appears spindly and lacking in strength . 
I think that this inharmonious result in the final structure of the package is down to a difference of opinion about the origins and nature of the crisis . 
The difference between those who believe that disorder and imbalances in public finances are at the root of the crisis and those who think that the underlying problem has to do instead with the lack of rules and transparency in the markets , economic and trade imbalances and social inequality . 
We risk confusing cause and effect . 
We all want public finances to be controlled responsibly , but the goal of reducing debt is not sufficient to kick-start growth and competitiveness . 
The main thrust of these measures lies in procedures and sanctions . 
Far less emphasis - too little emphasis - has been placed on investment and sustainable growth strategy , which Europe should promote and implement . 
We know that our actions can lead to widely differing results , even without our intending it , and can even have the opposite effect to the one we are seeking to achieve . 
This is the heterogenesis of purpose . 
I fear that this problem lies at the heart of this package . 
(ES) Mr President , we are clearly in a serious situation that calls for all of us to be responsible . 
All of us , including the Council . 
The difference that separates us today from the Council is the issue of reverse qualified majority voting . 
We all know that the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) has not worked because the Member States have decided not to punish each other for any violation of budgetary discipline . 
Perhaps this is because they have read in the Gospel the quote that says , ' Let he who is without sin cast the first stone ' . 
What this Parliament wants - and this is what distinguishes it from the Council - is to put an end to this joyous camaraderie between governments , and replace a biased referee with an impartial one . 
The package is good and deserves to be voted through . 
When times are hardest , no one would ever consider saying that we have to spend more . 
What we are now doing is restoring budgetary discipline . 
However , when something is good it is not necessarily enough . 
The speeches we have heard today have shown several things . 
We all knew that the eurozone was not an optimum currency area . 
Everyone thought that the current institutional framework - a centralised monetary policy , a Stability and Growth Pact , and the coordination of the other economic policies - would enable the differences between Member States to be overcome , or at least reduced . 
That has not been the case . 
In the good times , their differences only increased; in the bad times , the pillars on which the monetary union was established were left in ruins . 
The ' no-bailout ' principle , the ' no-default ' principle , and now the ' no-exit ' principle could also be out the window . 
We now find ourselves in Lenin ' s ' What is to be done ? ' situation . 
The only solution is to move forward on the issue of political union . 
I welcome the issue of Eurobonds . 
It is a positive step in that direction , but more needs to be done . 
If establishing a political union requires reforming the Treaties by convening a convention , so be it . 
There is a Greek proverb that says , ' rules are made for man , and not man for rules ' . 
It is not a question of continuing trialogues until three o ' clock in the morning or holding ministerial meetings at six o ' clock in the morning . 
From now on let us think about what can be done to remedy this situation . 
The first step , however , is to vote in favour of this package , which is a good step in the right direction . 
Otherwise we will be making a futile effort and , as Mr Ortega y Gasset was just saying , futile effort leads to melancholy and - in politics - to opposition . 
It leads to melancholy and also to speaking for longer than the time one is allocated , Mr García-Margallo y Marfil , through the President ' s indulgence . 
(IT) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this debate offers the opportunity to address the issue of a new agreement on governance in the European Union , to send a strong and unified message , to restore solidarity to the EU and to dispel speculation . 
It is a fact that in years gone by we have weakened the Stability and Growth Pact . 
An equally incontrovertible fact is that this was a mistake and we are paying the consequences . 
We must go back to rules of fiscal discipline , and this is the real issue , the real debate that we must have among ourselves . 
Procedures should be automatic so that we do not have the same experiences that we had with the old Stability and Growth Pact . 
I think that there is only one way to get out of the crisis; there are no shortcuts . 
The answer lies in national policies , in carrying out planned and agreed commitments . 
Solidarity between EU Member States must be accompanied by a sense of responsibility and must respect rules that Member States cannot and must not knowingly violate . 
Clearly in all this we cannot forget the importance of growth , which brings in internal revenue , and structural reforms to get struggling countries back on their feet . 
Structural reforms aimed at boosting the competitiveness of economies and the potential for growth must be the priority on the political agenda . 
I disagree with those who argue that the new Stability and Growth Pact will prevent States from developing . 
Rather , it will prompt them to clear out the dead wood , to modernise , to undertake those structural reforms that are the trigger for kick-starting the economy . 
Thanks to these and strict adherence to the rules established by the new Stability and Growth Pact , I am sure that the EU will gain in strength and will be able to face new challenges without assistance policies and , worse still , outdated slogans that lead nowhere and do only damage , especially among the weakest members of society . 
(FR) Mr President , the more Parliament boasts of the wonderful progress made on economic governance , the more I want to call on my fellow Members to show some humility , because we are teetering on the edge of the abyss . 
There are two things to which we need to open our eyes . 
The first is that the European Parliament has fallen silent during the Greek crisis . 
We are usually so quick to react to all sorts of events all over the world , with one resolution after another , and yet this fundamental crisis seems to have left us speechless . 
I deplore the fact that we have been incapable of sending a strong , simple , practical message to the Greek people , to the Member State governments and to Europe ' s citizens . 
The second item relates to the scope of this package . 
In voting for these six directives and / or regulations , as I hope we will , we will certainly be taking the euro area a step further , and I mean a step , nothing more , towards the kind of discipline that has been so lacking , and its value will be proven in the future . 
However , we only need to look at the heated discussions around the reversed qualified majority voting system to see how far we still have to go , when it is rules and automatic sanctions we should be talking about . 
Some people still see the reversed qualified majority system as something to be scared of . 
However , we must remain firm on this principle . 
From a strictly political point of view , I am disappointed that the left-wing Members continue to reject the principles of good budget management , against all the evidence . 
Deficits and sustainable growth cannot go hand in hand . 
States do need to manage their budgets according to good housekeeping rules , not by revitalisation through public expenditure , which is a short-term sweetener but never a lasting solution . 
As we approach these next few crucial weeks , our task is now to build new economic union . . . 
(The President cut off Mrs Lulling)
(Mrs Lulling agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))
(DE) Mr President , I am of course happy to say that and to confirm that . 
However , I should also like to say this: we are also addressing the Greeks . 
In Greece there are only 10 tax exiles who say that they earn more than EUR 1 million per year . 
I am addressing them too , just as Mr Langen addressed the communists . 
(DE) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , time is running out . 
Therefore , I would like to call for an end to the soapbox speeches , the finger-pointing and the party political game-playing , regardless of where these things are taking place . 
We need to do the job properly and to respond to the crisis on a step-by-step basis . 
What are the causes of the crisis ? 
We have constantly been emphasising the fact that the causes include a failure to comply with the rules , the blocking of sanctions and the lack of progress on taking the monetary union to the next stage . 
With our plans for economic governance , we are now calling for the Stability and Growth Pact to be strengthened , both in terms of preventive and corrective measures , for a majority in favour of the implementation of sanctions and for the Commission to have the right to intervene , when necessary , so that the citizens of Europe can rely on the rules being followed . 
My second point is that we want the monetary union to be taken to the next stage . 
This means establishing the economic union and not losing sight of the goal of political union . 
I have to say that I am disappointed by the results of the trialogue . 
It is not functioning properly at the moment . 
However , the fact that we do not have the Council ' s agreement in the dialogue on economic policy and that the European Parliament and the two sides of industry are involved in this is reducing our ability to become more integrated . 
We want to increase our levels of integration . 
Because the Council is not able to address the current imbalance in our society and to give Parliament the opportunity of making the ministers from the Member States directly accountable to us , the results of the trialogue are being weakened . 
We stand by these results . 
We want to resolve the open issues and bring about integration . 
If we allow our position to be weakened because of the weakness of the Council , we have not learned any lessons from the crisis . 
(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8) of the Rules of Procedure)
(DE) Mr President , I would like to ask Mr Karas a question . 
We are in the midst of a crisis in the single currency . 
We have discovered that we have fundamental problems , such as the lack of a common fiscal and economic policy . 
These findings by the economists and the academics are quite surprising to me . 
Do you really believe , Mr Karas , that no one was aware before the introduction of the single currency of the truism that common governance and political union are also needed ? 
Perhaps no one was quite brave or honest enough to tell the citizens of Europe this . 
(DE) Mr President , of course , everyone knew that and they said so . 
They said that monetary union is a political project , that the integration involved in monetary union is irreversible and that monetary union must be followed by the next steps towards integration . 
We have been heavily committed to this for years . 
Political groups like yours have stirred up feelings against the European Union , have said very little about the importance of the currency and the opportunity , the political will . . . 
(The President cut off the speaker)
(RO) Mr President , I am going to vote tomorrow on the legislative package on European economic governance . 
I would also like to thank in particular the rapporteurs , the Hungarian Presidency and the Commission for their really exceptional efforts , culminating in the clarification of this legislative package . 
This European economic governance package must be viewed in connection with the other legislative package on the financial sector , including Europe ' s financial supervision structure , which has already been adopted . 
I firmly believe that effective implementation of this legislation will ensure that no other Member State will ever again be exposed when faced with a future crisis . 
We will be able to prevent and adjust fiscal and economic imbalances , which is one of the best guarantees of economic growth and jobs . 
However , I must express my concern that European institutions are unwilling to acknowledge the economic reality with which we are currently faced . 
By this I mean that a Member State that has a debt which it can no longer pay cannot receive assistance , thereby adding a new debt to the existing one , with higher costs as well . 
We have learnt from experience and common sense that the solution lies in the debtor country putting its house in order , with the creditors realising that the debt to be paid needs to be arranged to match the relevant country ' s real ability to pay . 
If we are not going to proceed in this manner , far from saving time , we will waste time and the problem will get worse . 
(PL) Mr President , after listening attentively to today ' s debate , I should like to make a few comments , if I may . 
Firstly , reference has been made very frequently in this Chamber to stimulation of the economy by means of additional budgetary expenditure . 
I think that the Members concerned are forgetting that there are countries in the European Union - and not just one or two , and not only Greece - which have domestic debt of over 100% , the sole cause of which is stimulation of the economy . 
As a result , we have achieved a certain level of economic growth , albeit somewhat artificial growth , but we have been left with the bills to pay , and we have to pay them now . 
There was talk of restrictive solutions in respect of limiting the deficit . 
Yet the proposed solutions state that each country is to reduce debt to 60% within 20 years . 
If 20 years to halve debt is the long-term perspective , what is the short-term perspective ? 
I cannot imagine a longer-term perspective in this situation . 
Is it possible to abandon penalties , or is the penalty system a restrictive system ? 
Fifteen years ago , when I was still a student , I learnt about the convergence criteria , and their mandatory nature . 
Yet they were only mandatory criteria on paper . 
If they were mandatory for anyone , it was only for those who aspired to join the euro area , and they were not mandatory for anyone in the euro area . 
In view of the above , such a system cannot be successfully introduced without penalties , and without restrictive penalties , as some have said . 
These sanctions existed on paper , but , as we remember and as we know , there have been no real sanctions to date . 
My last comment relates to the fact that members of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament have said that we should implement the 2020 strategy , and not merely cut spending . 
Yet these very documents talk about a European semester , among other things . 
They also introduce a new procedure for excessive imbalances . 
One of the features of this instrument is that it gives the European Commission influence over whether the Member States are implementing the 2020 strategy or not , and so it is worth telling the truth . 
I would urge you to adopt this package , for a lack of agreement between the Council , the Commission and Parliament on this issue will . . . 
(The President cut off the speaker)
Mr President , compromise is wise . 
Certainly the Parliament in its negotiations has gone more than halfway towards a compromise , but I think we have reached the limit . 
Postponing decision-making on the package does not solve the problem . 
The problem will not go away . 
The same problems will face us again and will threaten the whole future of the euro and the EU if we do not have better coordination and more Community method . 
In the long run the EU is an economic union . 
We need to get to the core reasons for the problems . 
We are closer with this package , but we are still not close enough . 
I think that the reverse qualified majority is one of the issues at the core of the problem . 
This is not a time for populism and short-sighted policy-making , which , in my view , the Council has been doing to some extent sometimes . 
The Council , like Parliament , is responsible for Europeans . 
I hope that the Council , with the Commission and Parliament , will share their responsibility and take the necessary steps on this economic governance package and future actions . 
If the pieces are not right and not in order , plans for the future and the EU2020 are only futile and nice words , on which basis we really cannot build the future . 
(DE) Mr President , the European economic governance package sends out a clear signal that we must avoid debt crises wherever possible in future . 
We must take effective measures to prevent the euro from being destabilised . 
That is the basic message of this excellent report produced by Mrs Wortmann-Kool . 
In order to achieve this , we need greater political coordination between the Member States and strong supervision at an EU level . 
This supervision is an essential element of the Europe 2020 strategy . 
We must finally make consistent use of the Stability and Growth Pact , which forms the basis for the strong euro , in order to show the Member States with high budget deficits where the limits are . 
This is what the citizens of Europe are justifiably calling for and not only in the countries which are supposed to be showing solidarity in the form of constantly growing rescue packages . 
We must not allow any more excuses or uneasy compromises to be made when the Member States disclose their convergence programmes and budget policies to one another . 
The citizens will only be prepared to accept painful reforms if they are shown a clear picture of the situation , so that they can give their support to the necessary measures . 
In contrast to the widely held belief in nationalism , we do not need less Europe , but more . 
For example , we should strengthen our Community method which is based on the Treaty of Lisbon . 
The Commission must and will accept its responsibilities , identify trends in financial and economic policy at an early stage and ensure that the dialogue between the financial institutions and the policymakers is much more effective than it has been . 
Mr President , the measures we are discussing here this evening are to be welcomed . 
I think they show that the European Union has the capacity , the will and the intelligence to take measures arising out of the lessons we have learned from the economic crisis . 
And , particularly , I think that some have said that this is a transfer of powers from Member States to the European Union . 
This is the old hoary chestnut that is brought forward to object to every proposal . 
If you are part of the European Union it has to have some powers , and certainly we are sending out a message to the markets and the citizens that we can deal with crucial issues when they occur . 
Certainly , I agree completely with what we are doing and I also would love to see us adopting automatic , binding sanctions and also the reverse qualified majority voting system . 
That would ensure that we would stay out of crisis in the future . 
Prevention is better than cure and this is all about prevention . 
Learning from what we have learned already . 
(FR) Mr President , we need to establish economic governance in order to get the European Union out of this continuing crisis . 
We need to coordinate our policies; we need to be transparent in how we manage our national budgets and , above all , we need to bring down our deficits . 
However , do you really think you are on the right track ? 
The European right-wing is getting ready simply to abolish the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy . 
It refuses to implement the financial transaction tax and Eurobonds and its eyes are glued on the rating agencies , which did not see the subprime crisis coming , which shows just how reliable they are . 
Let us be clear about this: we are in a crisis that was brought about by neoliberalism and by the blind trust that governments and the EU placed in deregulated markets . 
And how do we intend to get out of it ? 
Through more neoliberalism and austerity . 
We need growth; we need to boost demand , and it is not by bringing our fellow citizens to their knees that we will achieve this . 
You are on the wrong track . 
(EL) Mr President , as a Greek , I wish to thank all my fellow members who spoke positively about Greece and to stress that I think that the survival of a State transcends party political divisions and positions . 
We are talking about a Europe of the future . 
We have still not understood and we are still trying to understand the Europe of the past , to understand how we got where we are today . 
I am sorry to say that some people have demonstrated senseless greed , especially in Greece; however , many others have demonstrated culpable greed . 
We say that private investment is the solution to the problem . 
The private investors have gone elsewhere . 
We tend to forget that . 
They have gone to other areas of the planet . 
There is no competitiveness in Europe; Europe is getting old; it is no longer competitive and has nothing to offer . 
What we . . . . . 
(The President cut off the speaker)
(HU) Mr President , I am grateful for the hard work of the rapporteurs , advisors , the Hungarian Presidency and everyone who made it possible for us to have the ' six-pack ' of economic governance here in this form today . 
It would be good to think that this package is no longer necessary and Europe ' s economic problems will be solved overnight . 
Unfortunately , this is not the case . 
Europe is not over the crisis yet , and if we do not act responsibly , we will have to face further crises in the future . 
I agree with those responsible thinkers who say that we have to adopt a more stringent budget and have to strengthen the Stability and Growth Pact . 
We have to say it out loud that the European Union has been taking an overly relaxed approach so far , it did not have mechanisms to react to crisis situations , and was therefore unable to respond adequately to the serious consequences of the crisis which caused economic , financial and social disturbances . 
We cannot let this happen again , and at the same time we have to learn from the failures of the past . 
(FR) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , rapporteur , good economic governance in Europe is necessary; of course it is . 
However , if we vote for these six texts , we will be leaving Member States no freedom to follow investment policies for stimulating growth . 
At a time when citizens are increasingly losing faith in the EU , when Greece is on its knees and the rating agencies are dictating to States , Parliament should stop this dogmatic insistence on austerity at all costs . 
The Union now wants to respond to a crisis of the neoliberal model with neoliberal formulas and systematic expenditure cuts , especially in social security , even though this expenditure is known to be a defence against economic crises . 
Without adding the elements advocated by the progressive groups in this Parliament , I do not see how we can agree to vote in favour of these texts . 
We would actually be creating a split personality for ourselves , considering that we have adopted resolutions on the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy and that we are drafting reports , as I am doing myself , on implementing the platform to combat poverty . 
The economic governance that is being proposed . . . 
(The President cut off the speaker)
(NL) Mr President , the tightening of the Stability and Growth Pact is urgently needed . 
The experiences of recent years make that clear . 
I am also pleased that the outcome of the negotiations is a step in the right direction . 
Ministers will never again be permitted to cover each other ' s backs when a Member State allows its public finances to derail . 
It would therefore be a good thing if we were to improve the prevention of major deficits by moving decision-making further away from politics . 
Rapporteur Wortmann-Kool is therefore right to insist on the idea that ministers should be able to block decisions by qualified majority only . 
However , a sticking point for me is Commissioner Rehn ' s statement , which is related to this legislative package . 
This is a step towards the introduction of Eurobonds . 
The President of the ECB has indicated that it would be undesirable to have Eurobonds introduced in a situation where budgetary discipline is lacking . 
Introducing new debts will exacerbate the European debt problem . 
Moreover , the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance want to exempt public investment from the standard of a maximum . . . 
(The President cut off the speaker)
- (SK) Mr President , the package of measures on economic governance is a businesslike response to the obvious problems of an economic and financial nature that have long plagued the European Union . 
The economic crisis has led many eurozone countries into serious debt problems , and it is clear that the rules of the stability pact did not protect the currency union from the results of amateurish and irresponsible management by the governments of some countries . 
Even though I do not think the European Commission should have more powers than it had previously , I agree that the European currency union must establish a more precise mutual control mechanism for budgetary policy . 
Some members of the currency union are paying for the irresponsibility or adventurism of others , and a move towards greater transparency and clearer budgetary rules leading to the avoidance of long-term problems in our countries has therefore become essential . 
It will be important , however , for us also to apply the rules we adopt consistently , and not to produce all kinds of exemptions from them (The President cut off the Speaker)
(RO) Mr President , a unified , EU-level strategy is required to ensure a high level of competitiveness , sustainable economic growth and job creation . 
A strong , effective Stability and Growth Pact is the key instrument in this . 
Indeed , additional efforts should be made to prevent unsustainable budgetary policies from being adopted . 
The enhanced economic governance framework will be underpinned by different interconnected policies . 
This package of proposals will help encourage Member States to apply a prudent budgetary policy and , if appropriate , to adopt corrective measures in good time to restrict penalties from being imposed . 
Prevention is easier than cure . 
(DE) Mr President , the line being taken by the governments of the core Member States of the EU , the European Commission and the European Central Bank can be clearly identified . 
New rescue packages are being put together for Greece , billions of euros of taxpayers ' money is being put at risk and plans are being drawn up for economic governance for the whole of Europe , as we have just heard . 
The main aim of the Commission ' s proposals is to tighten up the regulations of the Stability and Growth Pact . 
In future , compliance with the Maastricht criteria will be enforced by imposing much tougher penalties . 
However , this pact has not worked in the past and I am assuming that it will not work in the future either . 
At the same time , one mechanism after another is being put in place to support the countries with budget deficits , once again involving taxpayers ' money . 
We are treating the symptoms rather than eliminating the causes . 
This highly risky strategy will come back to haunt Europe in the short or the long term . 
It is unreasonable to expect the same hard-working countries always to pay for the mistakes of others . 
Vice-President of the Commission . - Mr President , I am not sure if I can respond to all of the Members . 
We would not have time for that , but I will try to provide some insights as regards the points made this evening . 
I want to , first of all , thank you all for a very substantial and substantive debate which reflects an overall sense of responsibility for Europe ' s economic future , for growth and stability , and for our citizens ' welfare . 
I believe we all broadly share the view that balanced and healthy public finances are a necessary condition for sustainable growth and improving employment , which is the goal of the current legislative package . 
That is why it deserves your support . 
As many of you have underlined , it is an essential building block in our comprehensive policy response to the current and still ongoing financial and sovereign crisis . 
Why is it so important to adopt this package at the current juncture ? 
Because we must be able to show our citizens , economic actors and the international partners that the European Union really can in future prevent a fiscal crisis such as the one we have recently experienced , in the case of Greece for instance . 
Never again . 
That is the first building block of this legislative package . 
That is why we need preventive budgetary surveillance and effective enforcement as proposed in the package and indeed by your rapporteurs and your committee . 
That is also why we need a genuinely and effectively functioning mechanism to identify and correct macroeconomic imbalances , in order to prevent the kind of crises we have seen , for instance in Ireland or the credit boom we have seen in Spain . 
That is why we need the second building block in this package: an effective mechanism to identify and address macroeconomic imbalances . 
Some of you , like Udo Bullmann , Sven Giegold and Philippe Lamberts , have asked whether we consider that the issue of symmetry / asymmetry has been settled . 
I can provide you with my interpretation and the Commission ' s interpretation of this issue which in fact , if you look at the texts , is extremely complicated . 
I hope that nobody would block this package for the sake of that because it would be impossible simply to explain it to our citizens . 
The drafts of both the Council and Parliament cover both the deficit and surplus countries . 
That is very clear . 
The differences in drafting would have no substantive impact on the scope or emphasis concerning the economic surveillance to be carried out . 
I hope that Parliament and the Council can work together and find an agreement that is based on the substance and not the semantics . 
There is practically no difference , so let us tick the box and conclude this important issue of symmetry / asymmetry so that we can start working in order to identify and also correct the macroeconomic imbalances and competitiveness divergences . 
So , all in all , your vote tomorrow will be a very important one , a very crucial one for the European Union and its capacity to convince our general public , economic actors and international partners of our capacity to overcome the crisis and facilitate sustainable growth . 
Therefore your vote tomorrow will be a great opportunity to achieve a historic milestone of complementing the monetary union finally with a true and genuinely functioning economic union - which we definitely need - and thus enabling the European Union to come out of the current serious crisis with lessons learnt , hopefully also stronger for the future and , in any case , with new appropriate policy tools for sustainable growth , employment and for our citizens ' benefit . 
President-in-Office of the Council . - Mr President , I am glad most of the contributions indicate that the job which was assigned to us - and by ' us ' I mean Parliament and the Council - to agree on a very ambitious and new economic governance package , is 99% completed . 
I am also in agreement with many of the honourable Members that , after the hard work of negotiations , we have to get the deal done . 
I am optimistic because , here in this House , I feel a commitment and a real sense of ownership towards the future of Europe . 
Let me make a few comments on the particular issue - which is still open -of the extension of reverse qualified majority voting . 
During the last six or seven weeks , the Council has discussed Parliament ' s proposals at least on a weekly basis . 
In the last four weeks the Finance Ministers of the 27 Member States discussed the package three times , and each time they made major concessions to Parliament on various points of the text in order to pave the way for a timely agreement . 
We discussed all aspects of all the proposals at various levels . 
Originally , you proposed that the reverse qualified majority voting rule be applied in more than 15 instances . 
In some cases it was not legally feasible to do so , and we identified where that was the case very quickly . 
Some of the other points in question were already included in the Council ' s general approach to the decision on imposing financial sanctions . 
In May , the Council agreed to reverse qualified majority voting in two places in addition to the general approach . 
On Monday the Council made large concessions , in the last case on the preventive arm of the Pact , including a review clause in three years ' time and the ' comply or explain ' procedure , which was strengthened in comparison with the previous agreement in the March Ecofin Council . 
These safeguards can give Parliament the necessary reassurance that deviation from the Commission ' s proposals and recommendations will be kept to a minimum and that cases of non-compliance with the rules , and thus the need for explanations , will be very rare exceptions . 
It is definitely time for Parliament to reconsider its initial position and to make a move towards the Council . 
The markets and investors are vigilant , and they would like to see whether we can deliver the agreement in the coming days or not . 
I believe it is essential for us to do so . 
In addition , this package could demonstrate how European institutions can cooperate in a responsible , efficient and constructive manner in such an important field . 
Several times during the trilogues , I heard serious criticisms from Members of Parliament about intergovernmental procedures . 
The swift and timely adoption of the package could prove that the Community method is the right approach to use in going forward . 
Mr President , I am grateful for everyone ' s contributions to this debate , and particularly the summaries given by Commissioner Rehn and the President-in-Office of the Council , András Kármán . 
I would just like to stress one point: concessions have in fact been made on both sides , and I think we are very close to agreement , but I would not like them to fail to note the question of symmetry and asymmetry as an important issue that needs addressing . 
That and reverse qualified majority voting are points on which adjustments are still being made , and there is no conclusion on them yet . 
I am particularly grateful for Commissioner Rehn ' s positive contribution but , if there is to be an agreement , it will have to be based on the legal text - on the articles section - including of course Article 32 , Article 42 and recital 11-A , as has been widely debated . 
I would therefore be grateful if you would bear this issue in mind , because it is one that cuts across the interests of several Members of this House and several political groups , as you have seen . 
Having said that , I think the new factor of the analysis of macroeconomic imbalances can be useful . 
I apologise , Commissioner , not only for detecting problems of bubbles in the property or financial markets , but also for pointing out the importance of Europe ' s major problem: the tensions generated by the completely divergent ways in which the economies that make up the euro area evolve . 
Right now these tensions are seriously threatening the existence of a common currency with a non-optimal monetary area , as was very well highlighted today by Mr García-Margallo y Marfil . 
The fact is that the European Union is imperfect and incomplete . 
What we are doing is not enough to make up for the faults that the European economy has at the moment , and I think that the caricature of blaming everything on the mistakes of the lazy , the lying and the wrong - compared with the virtuous who have no problems - is an extremely dangerous caricature that we must all avoid . 
After all , the history of Europe proves that simple explanations for complex problems never give good results . 
That , then , is the appeal that I am making here . 
Mr President , I am grateful for all the contributions that have been made to this debate , and I would like to express my very special thanks - because I did not do so just now - for the crucial role played in all this by Mrs Bowles , the Chair of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs . 
I want to point out that this economic governance package brings greater transparency for the institutions and a better and larger role for Parliament . 
The package also forms part of the euro ' s defences . 
Anyone who believes that the very best solutions for growth are not here must also admit that they do not know of any country that fails to grow if its public accounts are in order . 
Countries that show budgetary discipline are countries with economies that grow , and we must not forget that . 
That is the example that we must set here . 
That is the example that is being followed right now , for instance , in my country . 
I also want to put a question to all the Members of this Parliament: can you say that this economic governance package is worse today than when it arrived here ? 
Can you say that no improvements have been made to it by this House ? 
You cannot say that , because it is not true . 
This economic governance package today is better than the Commission ' s initial proposal , and it is better because of the many contributions made by the Members of this House . 
That is why we have to give our citizens a very clear answer . 
We want a growing European economy . 
We want stability . 
We certainly want transparency . 
To achieve all that , however , we must show a sense of responsibility at voting time tomorrow; we must necessarily vote responsibly and choose our partners very well . 
For my part , my choice is very clear: I will be voting for a better Europe and a better European economy . 
Madam President , my thanks to everyone for this debate , to the Commissioner and to the Minister , Mr Kármán . 
First of all , I wanted to say to the Minister that I think we have already proved that the Community method works well . 
As Diogo Feio just said , I think the text has actually been improved , and I think that when there is public debate we are doing our job and citizens can be informed about what is going on in Brussels , as they say . 
Why is it , therefore , that we are still talking about the reversed qualified majority ? 
I want to make a simple point . 
In this Parliament , there are countries for example with a larger population , who have more Members . 
When it comes to the votes , each country has a vote that matches its size . 
However , what democracy has a system whereby when it comes to applying the rule , we treat the people covered by the rule differently ? 
When it comes to putting into practice rules that we have agreed on together , we cannot start making exceptions . 
Citizens expect the law to be applied equally to everyone . 
At the European level also , all Member States , whether big or small , should be in the same boat . 
This is why we are fighting: it is not an ideological battle , it is a matter of the general interest . 
My second point is about symmetry , and I am addressing Mrs Ferreira in particular . 
This is an important issue: it is part of the agreement . 
We must be aware that it has been very expensive for some of us , and to ensure we see it through until the end , we need as wide a unity as possible in this Parliament on all the aspects of the deal . 
We need to be united . 
As the Commissioner said , I think there are no differences between us so great that we cannot overcome them . 
I am appealing for unity , therefore . 
We cannot ask for support and at the same time leave others in hardship . 
As for my last point , I wanted to thank Mr Kármán very specifically on the small point of ' comply or explain ' . 
I have asked you so many times during our discussions: what does that mean , ' comply or explain ' , and explain to whom ? 
You have been a good lawyer; you have moved the Council along . 
They are ready to do it in public . 
They are planning ahead for economic dialogue . 
Thank you . 
Ask them to go a bit further still: this is all we ask . 
You have done so very successfully , so I am sure we will get there . 
rapporteur . - (NL) Madam President , I , too , would also like to thank everybody who has participated in the debate and everybody who has supported us with such clear arguments . 
I would also like to thank Sharon Bowles , Chair of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , because the situation was very complicated and it will certainly be thanks to her if we get a positive outcome to the vote tomorrow . 
We have had quite an ideological debate today and it is clear that everyone in this House would like to have sustainable public finances and budgetary discipline , but history shows that you cannot achieve that by just spending more money . 
We now have a package before us . 
We have achieved a great deal . 
Commissioner Rehn has 15 points on his list and it could be that there are some Members who have problems with the detail in this package , but if you look at the alternative offered by the Left , it leaves us even worse off . 
I therefore hope that , tomorrow , Members will be prepared to rise to the challenge of this very important legislative package for this Parliament , which for the first time in its history is exercising co-legislative powers , just as the Council does . 
We will have to clear a few more hurdles next week , but hopefully we will have a positive outcome to the vote tomorrow . 
We therefore have one more week to go and I hope that we will ultimately be able to take a decision on first reading in July , because we are 98% there . 
On behalf of the European People ' s Party (Christian Democrats) , I would also like to emphasise what Mrs Goulard said about symmetry and asymmetry . 
There is indeed a give and take in this House and everyone has their priorities . 
However , that principle of give and take should also be applied , in terms of symmetry , to this Parliament eventually adopting a position on this package . 
- The debate is closed . 
The vote will take place on Thursday 23 June 2011 . 
Written statements (Rule 149)
At a time when the impact of the recession and public debt crisis is being strongly felt , we need robust economic governance at EU level . 
However , the economic governance legislative package would not , in its present form , help the European Union ' s economy to recover , but would bring about a situation where high unemployment and poverty would be permanent fixtures . 
I think that the proposals in this package are not ambitious enough , as they are only geared towards austerity and curtailing citizens ' social rights . 
There is no mention of elements which could underpin a European economic recovery , such as making investments in the key areas of infrastructure , education , research and innovation . 
We are able to propose an alternative to this austerity model which , as we can see from Greece , is proving to be extremely limited . 
The creation of bonds to be issued jointly for part of Europe ' s public debt would automatically reduce the cost of financing in the European Union and would allow the resumption of investment . 
Following the New Deal policy model from the United States , the solution to the current economic and financial crisis will involve restoring economic growth based on investments and creating new jobs . 
It is important that the EU does not just respond to the crisis by eliminating the most acute problems , but that it also prepares more fundamental reform of economic governance . 
Many points in the submitted reports go in the right direction , but at the same time they have a number of deficiencies . 
The proposals talk about tougher sanctions , about fines for the non-fulfilment of recommendations and about these being applied automatically , in order to avoid succumbing to political horse-trading . 
This is all very well . 
I cannot rid myself of the feeling that the sanctions are tailored to those states that are currently in a difficult situation . 
They seem to be based on the idea that these states can deal with the difficult situation themselves , and that they are capable of improving their situation by themselves through a ' disciplined ' approach . 
That is a mistake , however . 
Even before the crisis , a dynamic developed in Europe whereby the strong states of the eurozone cemented their competitive advantage . 
Thanks , among other things , to wage dumping in Germany , for example , the core countries strengthened their export position , and the peripheral countries became uncompetitive outlets for their products and capital . 
For these countries , the crisis was the last nail in the coffin . 
It is not possible to escape from this situation by willpower alone , or through one ' s own decisions . 
The situation regarding macroeconomic imbalances , particularly in countries with the single currency , can be resolved only through a consensual reassessment of the current model of economic development . 
It is not just cuts and budgetary discipline that will bring a solution , but a policy of targeted development and support for the competitiveness of Europe ' s periphery . 
As usual , on the pretext of sorting out problems that you have caused yourselves , you are imposing on us more Europe and more Commission power: this Commission that is little more than a handful of civil servants appointed with no democratic oversight , but that has been set up as a censor and slave-driver that will have the right to impose sanctions on Member States . 
Your pseudo economic governance goes far beyond budgetary oversight . 
It is nothing short of imposing oversight on our peoples and nations . 
This is an application of the doctrine of limited sovereignty that was so close to the heart of that great democrat Brezhnev , except instead of tanks we have financial penalties . 
I am not exaggerating: one of these reports feels it necessary to state that in the event of a change in majority after an election , the new government must obtain authorisation before altering its predecessor ' s budget priorities , and even then can only do so around the edges . 
As for the priorities themselves , they are those imposed by the European Union: repaying private creditors , reassuring the markets , dismantling social security and accelerating liberalisation at every turn , in keeping with the EU 2020 strategy . 
This is not correcting mistakes , improving public management or preventing another Greek situation: this is democracy held at gunpoint . 
The crisis may provide us with an opportunity to change our rules and institutions , or to create new ones . 
The economist Joseph Schumpeter talked about ' creative destruction ' . 
At present , the EU therefore has a unique opportunity to establish a new mechanism that should lead to greater macroeconomic , fiscal and currency stability for the Member States in the long term , and help increase their competitiveness . 
The experience we have gained from the past operation of the Economic and Monetary Union has shown that such rules need to be enshrined in legislation , and that we cannot rely on the good will of individual Member States . 
For this reason , the submitted legislative package containing six proposals for establishing an improved framework for economic management is a step in the right direction . 
Four proposals relate to fiscal matters , including a reform of the Stability and Growth Pact , while the two new regulations try to identify and resolve macroeconomic imbalances emerging within the EU and the euro area . 
In order to enforce these new rules effectively , however , it is and it will continue to be advisable for both the national parliaments and the European Parliament to be involved in the whole process more closely and at an earlier point in time . 
Overall , I believe that the legislative package which has been presented is an appropriate response to the global crisis and the EU ' s current economic situation , building on the relevant legislation and complying with the Europe 2020 strategy and other strategic EU documents , and therefore I recommend adopting it in the amended version . 
in writing . - (BG) The lack of suitable instruments for diagnosing public finance problems early , along with the poorly operating mechanisms of the Stability and Growth Pact , are among the basic causes of the long-running crisis which the euro area and EU are going through . 
This legislative package allows us to take appropriate measures to rectify the imbalances before they have an adverse impact on public finances . 
They will allow the European Commission to monitor , on an ongoing basis , the macroeconomic development of Member States and , if necessary , an in-depth analysis of national economies will be carried out . 
This is why the indicators for monitoring macroeconomic development and their thresholds must not be adopted automatically by the Commission , but must be analysed from an economic perspective . 
When the scoreboard is being produced , it is important that the different initial positions of the Member States are taken into consideration , along with their macroeconomic features , which differ for the countries in the euro area and the remaining countries in the EU . 
When analysing the indicators ' thresholds , consideration must be given to the catching-up process which new Member States are involved in . 
This is the only possible way of ensuring that an appropriate analysis of their macroeconomic development is carried out . 
in writing . - The economic integration of the European Union and in particular the euro has reached a juncture at which one can no longer turn a blind eye to unequivocal deviations from the criteria that have been set in order to safeguard economic stability in the Union . 
Therefore , I would call for enhancing the role of the Commission with regard to the economic governance of the EU . 
Ultimately , automatic mechanisms ought to be established and executed when certain Member States consistently breach the Stability and Growth Pact . 
The economic crisis has exposed the irresponsible financial and economic decisions of several governments , but it is the conscientious Member States that are paying the price . 
The crisis has taught us a painful , but all the more valuable lesson for the future . 
The Commission ought to be mandated to intervene without prejudice whenever it receives alarming signals from any Member State and the Council should not back the culprits . 
Much talked about solidarity will not be infinite and , unless we call the malefactors to order , the citizens of countries such as Estonia might lose their patience . 
Adoption of the economic governance package proves yet again that the European project is still alive and that it is on the basis of conciliation among the 27 that the Member States will overcome their difficulties and , at the same time , confront the challenges of the future . 
The sovereign public debt crisis shows that the current supervisory and remedial mechanisms are inadequate . 
The measures put to the vote today seek to strengthen the instruments that are not working , and therefore it is essential that they are put into practice . 
The debt criterion , as approved in the Treaty of Maastricht , is at last made operational in this new package and will now actually be applied . 
The institutionalisation of the European semester , the enhancement of the dialogue between the European institutions and national bodies , the role of Parliament and the Commission throughout the monitoring process , as well as greater and more effective supervision are all ways of achieving intelligent , sustainable and inclusive growth in Europe . 
However , I must stress that the success of Europe ' s economic policy must also depend on other , complementary measures to support investment and growth in the Member States . 
Europe must focus on a common strategy , but it must not forget the specific features of each country . 
As the past year has shown , the so-called Stability and Growth Pact , which was intended to provide an effective deterrent against violations of the macroeconomic principles of the euro area by the Member States , has not been terribly effective , to put it mildly . 
This is due to a large extent to the fact that the Member States believed they could act with impunity , since the sanctions provided for by the system were not automatic . 
We are in agreement as to the form of sanctions which would be imposed on countries in the euro area which exceeded the permitted level of deficit and public debt . 
However , it is equally important to take preventive measures , and therefore we in the European Parliament are in favour of introducing an automatic mechanism in the preventive arm of the Pact as well . 
The entire process also requires greater transparency , and this can only be ensured by greater involvement of the European Parliament and the national parliaments . 
In March and June 2010 , the European Council adopted the Europe 2020 strategy , the main priority of which is enhanced coordination of economic policy strategies in the Member States and , as a long-term goal , sustainable and inclusive growth and sustainable employment . 
Since economic governance regards public debt as equivalent to a deficit , we should make every effort to ensure that the medium-term budgetary framework which is put in place helps to reduce the burden on future generations . 
In doing so , we must use the experience gained during the first decade of functioning of the Economic and Monetary Union . 
Requirements pertaining to the rules and procedures that form the budgetary framework urgently need to be standardised , in order to ensure similar social protection benefits and to fight social exclusion . 
In view of the high level of interdependence between the budgets of the Member States and the EU budget , budgetary forecasts at both levels should be characterised by the same degree of transparency . 
This is why it is so important for an agreement to be in place between the Commission and each Member State as regards the scope of forecasts and forecasting methods . 
Cooperation of this kind would make it possible to avoid contradictory macrobudgetary scenarios and to increase the credibility of forecasts using for planning . 
The economic crisis and its repercussions have shown us that the EU ' s future needs to be built on European rather than domestic solutions . 
Coming up with a viable solution to the sovereign debt crisis and the need to strengthen the euro , return to a path of sustainable growth and create new jobs depend on efficient coordination between Member States and strengthening the Stability and Growth Pact . 
In a nutshell , this depends on a strong Europe , a goal also expressed in the motto of the European Council ' s Hungarian Presidency . 
The European economic governance package on the European Parliament ' s agenda can create the mechanisms the EU needs for its future , in the way that its architects imagined it . 
Adopting the economic governance package will entail close coordination , fiscal discipline , economic supervision , effective decision-making rules , powerful European institutions , thereby underpinning the EU ' s resurgence . 
The economic crisis has changed the world irreversibly and there is clearly an increasingly urgent need for a new financial structure in the EU . 
We are at a turning point . 
Any weakening of Member States ' ambition to complete the reforms which have been initiated under the strain of the crisis , excessive indulgence , too many exceptions to the commonly accepted rules and a return to a new round of internal protectionism will deal fatal blows . 
in writing . - (SK) I do not believe that governments or officials can manage the economy . 
At the same time , I understand that we must seek the causes of the financial problems of Greece and other EU states , and find a way to avert these in the future . 
Democracy meanwhile hangs in the balance , as we restrict the right of citizens to decide on the budget of their own state , and thus the priorities of state policy . 
Solidarity is possible , however , only if responsible governance is the rule for all . 
We are thus approaching a crossroads . 
One road leads to a slowdown in European integration , and possibly a break-up . 
The other road leads to tax harmonisation , the end of national budgets and a federal superstate . 
In a case such as that , however , we are also talking about a unified system of health insurance contributions , social insurance and pensions throughout the EU . 
It is these arguments , and not the empty phrases about unity , that make up the debate on a federal Europe . 
Spent fuel and radioactive waste (debate)
Τhe next item is the report by Romana Jordan Cizelj , on behalf of the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy , on the proposal for a Council directive on the management of spent fuel and radioactive waste - C7-0387 / 2010 - 2010 / 0306(NLE)) . 
Madam President , we are dealing with a legislative proposal with which we will , for the first time , be introducing European standards for the handling of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel . 
Two years have passed since we adopted a directive on nuclear safety and since then increased attention has been paid to the safe operation of nuclear power plants . 
The European Parliament has also several times called for a directive on the management of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel . 
The events in Fukushima have shown that we were right to do so because spent nuclear fuel stored in a temporary pool may also present a risk which can be forestalled with appropriate measures . 
The Committee on Industry , Research and Energy (ITRE) is very much in favour of the idea of a European directive , but we want it to be more rigorous in certain places . 
In our report , we have paid attention to the technological aspects , the provision of financial and human resources and independent , strong and competent regulatory bodies . 
Let me give you a little more detail on our positions . 
Even the best ideas , much as they may be desirable , will not become reality if there is not enough finance . 
In the ITRE , we have essentially reinforced the finance requirements . 
For us , it is not enough for these resources to just be adequate and available . 
At the political level , we have to ensure that these two requirements are implemented and we therefore support greater transparency and supervision of financial resources . 
We are also introducing a requirement that the monies should be used for a specific purpose . 
We have also upheld the implementation of the polluter pays principle , and that I consider to be one of the key demands of the European Parliament . 
We have also responded to public concerns concerning the safety of disposed-of nuclear fuel and supported the principle of reversibility . 
We have taken the position that spent nuclear fuel must be controlled . 
However , for technical reasons or in case of new technological solutions , such fuel could be extracted , processed or recycled and reused . 
We have significantly tightened the transparency requirements and set out the details concerning public participation , the information which is to be given to the public and the method of communication and participation in procedures . 
In this context , we have referred to the Aarhus Convention . 
Our Committee is in favour of regional cooperation . 
However , in order to ensure regional cooperation does not serve merely as an excuse to delay decisions , we have added a whole raft of requirements which such cooperation should meet . 
We have paid particular attention to the protection of workers who handle spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste , compliance with the ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable) principle which is established in practice , the need for education and training as well as the need for the development of scientific and technological skills . 
I would particularly like to emphasise our position on the export of radioactive waste . 
I dare say that not a single member of the Committee is a nimby ( ' not in my backyard ' ) . 
We are not in favour of irresponsible management and we want radioactive waste to be disposed of safely . 
On the other hand , we know that there are exceptions where export is allowed . 
We have therefore supported the amendment which allows exports to countries which operate the same standards that we will be introducing in the EU with this directive . 
For example , we should not be exporting radioactive waste to countries that have no final disposal facilities . 
We have also tabled an amendment in which we are demanding that the European Commission , once the peer reviews have been completed , evaluate the concept of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel management . 
Particular emphasis should be placed on the reversibility principle and the export requirements . 
Ladies and gentlemen , the European Parliament has only an advisory role under the Euratom Treaty . 
We have worked hard and I would like to think that our work will not be in vain . 
I therefore expect the European Commission and the Council to respect our positions and I ask that , during this debate , you support the positions adopted by ITRE . 
Member of the Commission . - (DE) Madam President , honourable Members , today we are discussing a Commission proposal on a subject that concerns Europe and that is on Parliament ' s agenda for the second time . 
The Commission ' s first proposal was not adopted in 2003 and 2004 . 
We believe that it is sensible and advisable at a European level to apply the highest safety standards to the use of nuclear energy , regardless of the purpose for which it is being used , and to the management of nuclear waste . 
I would like to thank Mrs Jordan Cizelj for her comprehensive report and for her work over the last few weeks . 
I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs from the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy and from the other committees . 
My officials tell me that you have produced a highly factual and competent report . 
We are pleased that it supports the essential aspects of the Commission proposal , which is intended to be an important building block in the development of a comprehensive European legal and regulatory safety system at the highest possible level . 
I am pleased that you fundamentally agree with the concept of the European legal framework and that you support our proposals on the responsibility for the national programmes , on clear working , timing and financial requirements , on information and on the full involvement of the general public at an early stage in every national implementation process . 
We want to work jointly to ensure that we have detailed and reliable proof of the waste management routes and their safety , particularly as the storage periods will be very long . 
We believe that many of the proposals that you have drawn up are well-informed . 
They support and strengthen the Commission ' s approach . 
I would like to make some additional remarks about four specific areas . 
Firstly , the basic principle is that we do not want to regulate every detail of the fundamental concept of subsidiarity . 
The starting position of all the Member States is different . 
We want to put in place a European legal framework . 
The essential points that are important for safety and for standards are included in the draft document . 
For example , we have left room for manoeuvre with regard to the type of public participation , the education and training of employees and managers and the details of the financial models - not the quality of the financing - and we are deliberately leaving open the regulation of the final storage facilities built and / or operated jointly by several Member States . 
Where necessary , we can make recommendations in this area , if we need to be more specific later in the process . 
However , I am sure that this proposal will not be the last to be submitted over the next 20 years . 
I expect that we will need to add to or amend the contents during the implementation process over the next two to five years . 
This is why the Commission is explicitly offering all of you the opportunity to revise the directive at the right time , so that we can learn from our experiences and improve the directive even further . 
Secondly , if we look at the issue of the reversibility of the stored fuel elements and waste , the principle is that every storage facility must be suitable and safe for permanent final storage , from a geological and a technical perspective and as far as its construction is concerned . 
However , we are aware that there will be developments in the fields of research and science . 
At the moment , there are growing expectations that in the foreseeable future , over the next few decades , developments during the next or next-but-one generation of science will enable us to recycle or store waste more effectively than we can today . 
Therefore , we believe the option of reversibility and , in the meantime , of constant access and security to be equally important and we want to be able to incorporate this into national legislation and perhaps to make it clearer in the preamble . 
Thirdly , we specifically support the rapporteur ' s views on the importance of adequate financing for national waste management programmes . 
For this reason , the Commission proposal includes important requirements concerning financing which aim to ensure that we do not impose an excessive burden on future generations . 
Therefore , we want to guarantee that appropriate funding is made available at the right time and in accordance with the ' polluter pays ' principle , that the national programmes include detailed and reliable cost forecasts and that the employees and the population as a whole are given information about all the issues relating to waste management . 
It is important that the financing is also transparent . 
We also support the proposals that the financing of waste management must be guaranteed over suitably long periods . 
We will submit these proposals to the Council on your behalf . 
My last point concerns exports . 
The basic principle of our proposal is that every Member State , regardless of how many , if any , nuclear power stations it has and what volume of waste it usually has to process , because every Member State has nuclear waste from medical devices and from industrial research , even if it has no power stations , must take responsibility for its own tasks and also enter into bilateral agreements and develop solutions with other Member States . 
In principle , exports to third countries are not in the interests of Europe . 
In my home country of Germany in the 1970s and 1980s , large amounts of hazardous waste were exported to the former German Democratic Republic and to Eastern Europe and stored there in return for payment in facilities which did not even come close to meeting the standards of the time and which did not provide the best possible protection for the environment and for the population . 
This is also a concern in this case . 
For this reason , we in the Commission are prepared to adopt every possible restrictive solution , including export bans and export restrictions . 
We want to call on Parliament not to support the opening up of this area , but to support a restrictive solution . 
This will make it easier for us to ensure that the Council does not water down the export restrictions at the end of the procedure . 
I would like to thank you very much for your constructive support today . 
I am sure that in a few years we will be discussing this subject again in Parliament with the aim of extending and improving this first directive . 
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs . - Madam President , let us hope that , when we come to review this directive , we can do it on a different legal basis . 
Our committee took the view that the legal basis should be Article 153 of the Treaty , as this matter directly concerns health and safety . 
We also underlined the importance of providing information and genuine consultation with workers concerning the safety case and safety assessments , not only of sites dealing with spent fuel and radioactive waste , but also as regards how these should be transported , and the need for a rigorous and effective inspection regime with sanctions that are effective , dissuasive and proportionate . 
We also want to see that all licence holders ensure thorough and ongoing training of all involved in dealing with these substances , including subcontractors - potentially a weak link in the safety chain - casual workers and all others working on site , whatever their job . 
We also took the view that there was no easy divide between civil and military waste , given that civilians may well handle military waste these days . 
Madam President , I would like to offer my sincere congratulations to the rapporteur on the outcome of her work . 
As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , I was given an opportunity to experience first-hand how the technical proposal became a highly political subject overnight , and therefore I would also like to thank all of my fellow Members who succeeded in maintaining an objective approach , even in the face of pressure following the disaster in Japan . 
In particular , I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs on the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety for helping to ensure that the Committee ' s opinion was of such high quality . 
I believe that the Directive will establish a legal framework in the European Union for the management of spent fuel and radioactive waste , and will form an integral part of EU legislation , ensuring the safe use of nuclear energy in those Member States which retain it in their energy mix . 
Among other things , I very much welcome the demand for Member States to secure sufficient funding for expenditure associated with the management of spent fuel . 
I myself have visited several radioactive waste storage facilities , and I firmly believe that a shortage of funding might directly lead to them becoming less safe , which is something we must prevent in Europe . 
Madam President , I welcome this report on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament . 
It is the result of long debates , consultations and negotiations , and we will support it unanimously tomorrow . 
We have been using nuclear technology for energy production , pharmaceuticals manufacturing , and for powering submarines and icebreakers for 60 years . 
And over the past 60 years we have failed to find efficient solutions for the management and long-term storage of hazardous waste . 
We support this directive , even if we do not agree with every element of it , because it reduces political obstacles and establishes the necessary financial conditions and independence . 
Although we have different opinions about energy production , we all agree , based on the ' polluter pays ' principle , that the waste produced in the European Union has to be stored within the EU , even if reprocessing takes place in a third country . 
We support the initiative to reduce waste to a minimum , and , if research and development results make it possible , to perform further recycling , because the principle of reversibility is very important for us . 
We also consider it extremely important to keep in mind the human factor . 
It is imperative that we guarantee the human factor , and the safety of employees is closely connected to this and has to be a priority during waste storage . 
However , we also consider it important to mention that the current legal basis does not provide sufficient European solutions , because we do not have co-decision rights . 
This is why we believe it is important to find a new legal basis in the future . 
Finally , Europe has to be a leader as regards both regulations and the construction of storage facilities .
