However , we consider that the discussion in paragraphs 26 and 27 regarding the jurisdiction of the EC Court of Justice in certain areas is a Treaty matter on which the European Parliament has already stated its opinion . 
However , there is another aspect that should worry us , which is the fact that , according to the Greek Government , there is strong evidence that many fires were caused by organised arsonists . 
We do have one quantitative target , however , which has been unchanged since the year 2000 . 
In the long term , however , it remains to be seen which other measures are adopted in this respect . 
However , there is still one fly in the ointment: we wanted certification of toys by independent testing institutes , so that we can also be really sure . 
However , a minute ' s silence must make us reflect and also lead us to reflect on things that go beyond our immediate concerns here . 
However , the Council must not try to ration information in order to save money . 
However , there is an even greater rise in uninsured , uncertain employment , which not only does nothing to improve the population ' s standard of living , but also undermines it .

However , anyone who thinks that we will have solved anything by reducing carbon dioxide emissions from the ever-increasing number of vehicles we use to 120g or 95g is gravely mistaken .

And , further to what Mr Schulz said about the dangers of a negative coming from Europe , it behoves me , as a representative from Ireland , speaking at this round of the debate on the future of Lisbon , to point out a number of home truths . 
It is in the interests of all Europeans to adhere to minimal conditions of employment and clear rules . 
We in the Commission have made a declaration that is contained in the minutes of the JHA council meeting of 23 October 2009 . 
The EU ' s role as initiator and coordinator in strengthening the single market is indisputable . 
In national strategic reports Member States set out how they will develop their policies to meet the common objectives . 
In some countries the removal of the quasi-constitutional symbols was actually used to argue that there was no reason to hold a referendum on the Treaty of Lisbon . 
A mechanism needs to be found for complying with the reporting conditions requested by the European Commission in circumstances where the provisions of the previous regulation on informing the Commission about investment projects in energy infrastructure within the European Community were not complied with by all Member States .

In the communication review of EU policy on innovation in a changing world , issued on 2 September 2009 , the European Commission outlines the developments that have taken place since 2005 in the field of EU innovation policy . 
In the case of Turkey , the pre-accession assistance is not only benefiting a non-European country , but is also , in some cases , disappearing into the pockets of corrupt officials . 
I have in my hand the letter from Janusz Śniadek , the head of the Solidarity Trade Union , on this . 
Every one of us , to a greater or lesser extent , creates his own sense of belonging to family , community , region , firm , church , society or political party , to the nation , to the civilised world and , ultimately , to the population of this planet . 
All Member States must ultimately provide the financial resources and adequately trained staff for the SOLVIT centres . 
The truth is , of course , that we do not mean to impose anything at all; on the contrary , we wish to offer a wide range of possibilities to help Member States who so desire to introduce , in their own time , the ' polluter pays ' principle into the road transport sector . 
All these technical solutions are interlinked and , in our opinion , the rights of defence of defendants must always be guaranteed in all circumstances . 
Every non-EU worker wishing to settle in Europe will still have to get a residence permit first . 
We all know that this is extremely important from the aspect of the functioning of the European Financial Stability Facility . 
According to its guidelines , the strategy must bear in mind the statements and concerns that we have dealt with in this House; the need to fight against terrorism , as well as the issues of human rights , the right to privacy , and to protection of personal data . 
You also mentioned in reply to me that the European Social Fund could be used for training . 
In this context , the EU should strongly back Taiwan ' s participation in the International Civil Aviation Organisation and in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change , as Taiwan ' s participation in these organisations is important to the EU and global interests . 
In this specific case , we believe that the emission performance standards for new light commercial vehicles must not ignore either the diversity of the automotive manufacturers or the legitimate interests and needs of small and medium-sized enterprises in the various Member States . 
We have a lot to learn from other European countries in this respect . 
In this agreement , the stated objectives in relation to development and integration at regional level are not in accordance with the measures deployed to achieve them . 
In any case reports to the Commission will be practically automatic , since they will be based on satellite surveys . 
In the last few months , this National Council has set an example in these countries of Africa by organising a major process for the Guinean people on the basis of the commitments made by Mr Camara . 
The launch of the new website at the start of 2009 is a welcome measure . 
In that regard , I would like to raise the very important work that is being done by the SOLVIT network and the European consumer centres . 
I agree in this respect with my fellow Member , who is proposing the creation of a single European access portal for all documents , with a structure which makes it easy for anyone to understand . 
As regards research and development , you agreed that this is precisely where Europe ' s future lies . 
For one can fight for democracy only according to the rules of democracy . 
I am satisfied by the way in which the new European Commission Humanitarian Aid civil protection system is operating , by the help provided by the European institutions , and by the collaboration that has been established through the different agencies . 
We need to ensure that the few do not taint the many and that our work benefits from outside inputs rather than being distorted by it . 
I also wish to thank rapporteur Ungureanu for this compelling and necessary report . 
Delivery will require a collective effort by all stakeholders at all levels . 
I would like to end by mentioning that I am aware of the differences between the views of Parliament and the Council when it comes to working time . 
Unfortunately , that agreement is in contradiction with the common position and basic principles of the European Union . 
Unfortunately this is nothing new; it is a growing phenomenon and , above all , one that cannot be treated as an emergency year after year . 
For some other political forces , human rights were less important . 
Closing one ' s eyes to what has happened in Japan and pretending that nothing has taken place is insensitive and dangerous . 
The crisis that has occurred in all sectors of the energy industry has led to the industry , which has woken up to climate change , not obtaining the technology it needs quickly enough . 
As a result of melting , the extraction potential in the new territories will increase to 200 m below the surface , involving millions of square kilometres . 
For this reason , I have focused in this report not so much on the individual areas , but primarily on what has happened in the last few years since the 2007 Blue Paper was published , what still needs to be developed and what has to be continued . 
We must use strategy papers for the different countries and other similar types of documents as the basis for the development of a coherent strategy relating to human rights in the country and the situation as regards democracy . 
Next , you have to recognise the long-term strain that pensions are putting on the government and make that very clear . 
I would therefore ask the fundamental question of whether there really is any point continuing to waste billions of euro on these European parties . 
The conditions and principles of trade on the global market therefore have important consequences for European agriculture . 
It is therefore vital that equal treatment is recognised for workers placed by temporary employment agencies , even in terms of wages , in the user undertaking . 
It is therefore advisable to formulate a position which will safeguard the interests of both consumers and traders . 
That is why it is important , in the future , that the report on competition should also focus on the lack of implementation of the legislation which is already in place , and also on the lack of competition in the European economy . 
I therefore believe that the necessary evaluations should be carried out and it will be confirmed that it is absolutely necessary for the financial details of the agreement to be updated because , inter alia , the Commission already saw the tariff of EUR 176 per tonne itself as low when it was implemented . 
The European Union should therefore continue to take an active approach to building positive relations with Turkey , inter alia , by increasing funding for joint strategic energy investments such as the Nabucco gas pipeline , and by means of greater support for the development of trade relations . 
The report should thus take into account , for example , the geographical location of reserves: this will contribute towards more effective energy use and better energy security in the European Union as a whole . 
Therefore , with regard to the principle of subsidiarity , there should not be any regulation at all at European level . 
I therefore call on the Czech Presidency to ensure that this domestic problem is resolved and that it serves as an example to the other EU Member States . 
So , please , when are we going to acknowledge that agriculture . . . 
Therefore I have asked my services to enquire whether such protection has been achieved and to examine whether the rules of the Takeover Bid Directive have been respected by the Greek authorities in this case . 
This is why I welcome and have supported the report by Mr Reul on conventional sources . 
We are therefore open to entering into the trade relationships that best suit the Pacific region as a whole , and the ongoing negotiations will inform the ultimate choices . 
I therefore hope that the EU will take a strong , consistent position to this conference , with ideas about the concrete measures that will be taken to guarantee the contribution that biodiversity protection will make to sustainable development . 
I express my confidence in the good judgment of the European Central Bank , in the integrity and independence of the European Central Bank and the politicians ' reserve to interfere with this bank ' s decisions . 
We must be aware that a repetition of last year could have real adverse effects on food security within the EU . 
To conclude , I would like to thank you all again , and I hope that today ' s work is not the end of the story , but that we may be able to achieve even greater goals . 
It is now up to the governments whether or not we will be able to put an end to the over-pollution of the River Raba and other European rivers in a similar situation . 
There is now even a law that protects the right of men to sexual gratification without any say from the women involved . 
A working group , chaired by the Attorney General and consisting of the Secretaries of State for Defence and Homeland Security and high level officials , has just started work . 
Healthcare systems are also cause for concern , as they often prove inadequate . 
I would like specifically to pick up on Professor Meyer ' s comments , as communicated by Mr Schwab . 
We want the inhabitants of Kosovo to benefit from the visa waiver; however , whatever the solution found , it must not prejudice the final arrangements concerning its status . 
It is very important that this proper way of thinking gains a firm foothold in Bosnia and Herzegovina ' s own political debate , so that its citizens can draw their own conclusions about what sort of policy they have the right to expect from democratically elected politicians . 
I am very grateful in general for the work of this Parliament and its support on human rights issues . 
We now see women in major roles in politics , business , industry and the media . 
Instituting these measures would greatly contribute to preventing the situation from deteriorating , and would help our growers to adapt to exceptional circumstances . 
In particular , by agreeing to establish a European Stability Mechanism and to make the linked Treaty change , we have demonstrated our total commitment to supporting the euro area and the Member States that use it for the benefit of the entire EU . 
Scientific research shows that this sector is uniquely capable of capturing carbon in a natural and non-polluting form . 
The reform allows a relatively long transitional period because the partly coupled aid can run until 2009 . 
With each successive growth in numbers of parliamentarians , working groups , committees and plenaries have become unwieldy and increasingly ineffective .
